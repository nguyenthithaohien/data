Dandelion leaves can be harvested at any point in the growing season, and while the smaller leaves are considered to be less bitter and more palatable raw, the bigger leaves can be eaten as well, especially as an addition to a green salad. If raw dandelion leaves don\u2019t appeal to you, they can also be steamed or added to a stir-fry or soup, which can make them taste less bitter. The flowers are sweet and crunchy, and can be eaten raw, or breaded and fried, or even used to make dandelion wine. The root of the dandelion can be dried and roasted and used as a coffee substitute, or added to any recipe that calls for root vegetables.\nThis common lawn weed (not to be confused with the tropical fruit also called plantain) is not only a great medicinal plant that can be used topically to soothe burns, stings, rashes, and wounds, but is also a great edible green for the table. The young leaves of plantain can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, or sauteed, and while the older leaves can be a bit tough, they can also be cooked and eaten as well. The seeds of the plantain, which are produced on a distinctive flower spike, can be cooked like a grain or ground into a flour, and are related to the more well-known psyllium seeds, which are sold as a fiber supplement and natural laxative.\nYou\u2019ll definitely know if you accidentally brush against this plant in the wild with your bare skin, as the leaves are covered in thousands of tiny stinging hairs. But don\u2019t let that scare you away. Stinging Nettle, which thrives along shady trails and riversides, has edible leaves, stems and roots, and contains more protein than beans and 29 times more calcium than spinach. Cooking and drying neutralizes the sting. Steep the tender young leaves in hot water for an iron-rich tea, or use them like an herb in all sorts of dishes.", "is_fake": 1},

That\u2019s because when you do have enough iodine in your body, the radiation doesn\u2019t have anywhere to bind itself to, so it will simply pass through your body without harming it. This is why it is crucial to have enough iodine in your system before the fallout even hits.You can find iodine in a number of food sources, including cod, seaweed, shrimp, eggs and tuna. Because the body cannot store it, these iodine-rich foods need to be consumed regularly in order to remain protected. Potassium iodide supplements can also be used, and it\u2019s highly recommended to keep them on hand if you happen to live near a nuclear zone.Being exposed to radiation can be extremely stressful, so you might want to stop and take a deep breath \u2013 literally. If you focus on your breathing and make a point of inhaling all the way to the base of the abdomen, you can help your body remove carbon dioxide and breathe out toxins while breathing in more life-giving oxygen.

Roman commander Vespasian intended to send Josephus to Roman emperor Nero (A.D. 37-68). But to this action, Josephus response was really odd. He stated that he has come as a messenger of great tidings. He was well versed with the laws of Jews and he questioned Vespasian about the existence of Nero and his successors until his own endurance.Josephus proclaimed that Vespasian is to be Caesar. After stating so Josephus asked Vespasian to bind him and keep him securely with himself.

On average, a person spends around 2-4 hours a day crooked over looking down at their personal devices.

Also, through a number of mechanisms they reduce the likelihood that plaque will form in your arteries.", "is_fake": 1},
{"date": 2020, "title": "Top 10 Codes You Aren\u2019t Meant To Know", "text": "The Ten Codes are a list of codes used by law enforcement officers in the United States. They are available on the Internet which would make them seem inappropriate for this list, but a large number of police departments have tried to have them made illegal for distribution, so they deserve a mention. The codes were developed initially in 1937 and were expanded in 1974. The California Police use a variety of extra codes which predated the ten codes. For example, a 187 (one eighty-seven) means homicide. In the ten codes system, a 10-31 means that a crime is in progress, a 10-27-1 means homicide (the 10 is usually not said when it is a three-number sequence), and a 10-00 (ten double-zero) means \u201cofficer down \u2013 all patrols respond.\u00a0\u00a0In computer support, a variety of codes can be used when referring to a customer. One of these codes has become fairly well known on the internet: PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair) but there are a variety of others that are lesser known. One of these is used when reporting a fault which has been fixed: \u201cThe fault was a PICNIC\u201d (problem in chair \u2013 not in computer), or \u201cID 10 T Error\u201d \u2013 ID 10 T is, of course, IDIOT. Let us hope that you never see this noted down on your file when a serviceman is fixing your computer.", "is_fake": 1},
