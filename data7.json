{"date": 2018, "title": "How CBD Is Changing The Dog Supplementation Landscape", "text": "As the saying goes, dogs are humans best friend. It is, therefore, important to consider the long term health and wellness of our loyal pets. Cannabidiol or CBD is a breakthrough supplement derived from the cannabis sativa plant. Due to the Hemp Farming Bill and focus on medical marijuana, studies on the benefits of using cannabinoids are published daily by the National Institute of Health. Unlike THC, which produces the \u201chigh\u201d or euphoric feelings associated with the drug, CBD has no psychoactive effects. It does maintain the plants well documented benefits for supplementation targeting pain and inflammation. Both dogs and humans poses the endocannabinoid system, where phytocannabinoids interact with the heart, brain, and nervous system, to achieve states of heightened relaxation. The long term benefits of giving any mammal species CBD have only begun to be studied, but the future is bright. CBD Clients report tumors and cancer recession, decreases in pain and inflammation due to arthritis and old age, the stoppage of seizures, and less overall neurosis or anxiety in their dogs.For dogs one of the most common issues with age is arthritis due to birth defects like hip dysplasia, trauma, infections, diet, and lack of exercise. If the dog\u2019s activity level decreases due to pain or immobility they often become overweight. This leads to further joint pressure and worsening symptoms, a sort of negative feedback loop. Cannabinoids are a well documented anti-inflammatory. Reducing your dogs inflammation has a twofold effect, for one it allows your dog to be more active, using the joint strengthens the muscles and tendons surrounding the area. Secondly this increased activity as well as the stimulated appetite brought about by CBD will decrease any negative weight gain.Anxiety is another commonly observed dog dysfunction brought on by the hardships of life or poor ownership. Rescue dogs especially tend to be high strung from previous environments, which can make for an especially difficult transition with a new owner or home. CBD is a naturally relaxing agent, producing not only a calming effect but a reduction in phantom pains or sensations. Think of the applications CBD offers for pundits of rescue shelters and pet adoption! Often a dog\u2019s behavior and temperament is the sole deciding factor to whether or not a potential owner will commit.", "is_fake": 1},

When a great fire leveled much of Rome in A.D. 64, Emperor Nero, seeking to shift blame from himself, accused the Christians of starting the blaze.

Among those crucified was St. Peter\u2014disciple of Jesus Christ, leader of the Apostles and the first bishop of Rome\u2014who was supposedly buried in a shallow grave on Vatican Hill. By the fourth century and official recognition of the Christian religion in Rome, Emperor Constantine began construction of the original basilica atop the ancient burial ground with what was believed to be the tomb of St. Peter at its center. The present basilica, built starting in the 1500s, sits over a maze of catacombs and St. Peter\u2019s suspected grave.\nRoman Emperor Caligula built a small circus in his mother\u2019s gardens at the base of Vatican Hill where charioteers trained and where Nero is thought to have martyred the Christians.

The brief is the perfect blend of nine-to-five and last summer\u2019s bike shorts. On runways, this trend was showcased with knee-high boots. This goes to show it will take over fall as well. The boxy blazers paired on top bring back a nineties vibe that reminds us of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Although the film\u2019s red pantsuit has been criticised over the years, it appears to have reemerged with a vengeance. Especially with\u00a0Short short short pants are also staging a massive comeback in 2020 since they first graced the streets in the fifties. Back in the day, they were regarded as a disgrace and frowned upon. Today, designers are giving them a triumphant update in denim, leather, metallics, and a whole other lot of options. This trend applies to skirts as well. Mini skirts reigned supreme in most runways this season, and so did maxi skirts. Most long skirts came with long slits, which is something that is predicted to hit the streets quickly.", "is_fake": 1},

Once you have a particular identity \u00a0and set of beliefs about yourself, you become interested in seeking out the skills needed to express your identity and beliefs. This is why people who believe they are creative become creative. If you believe you are not creative, then there is no need to learn how to become creative and you don\u2019t. The reality is that believing you are not creative excuses you from trying or attempting anything new. When someone tells you that they are not creative, you are talking to someone who has no interest and will make no effort to be a creative thinker.You must have passion and the determination to immerse yourself in the process of creating new and different ideas. Then you must have patience to persevere against all adversity. All creative geniuses work passionately hard and produce incredible numbers of ideas, most of which are bad. In fact, more bad poems were written by the major poets than by minor poets. Thomas Edison created 3000 different ideas for lighting systems before he evaluated them for practicality and profitability. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced more than six hundred pieces of music, including forty-one symphonies and some forty-odd operas and masses, during his short creative life. Rembrandt produced around 650 paintings and 2,000 drawings and Picasso executed more than 20,000 works. Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets.

In one Chinese study, it was found that magnesium in sufficient quantities will prevent the formation of the free radicals that can lead to hearing loss. In a study at the Mayo Clinic, it was found that treating patients who had experienced hearing loss with magnesium supplementation often helped restore that loss within three months.\nMagnesium is crucial to optimim muscle function. Without it, the body would be in a state of convulsion, because it is this mineral that allows the muscles to relax. That is why, for instance, a magnesium oxide drip is used to ease women in labor and why magnesium is found in so many sleep-inducing supplements. A lack of sufficient magnesium, therefore, can lead to facial tics, muscle cramping and twitching or cramping of the feet while trying to sleep.The link between low magnesium levels and depression was understood over a century ago, when doctors would use it to treat this mental health disorder. Modern science has backed this up, with a study at a psychiatric hospital in Croatia finding that many attempted suicide patients had severely low levels of this important mineral.

According to an anonymous insider, when he first entered psychiatric care he reported hearing voices. Shortly after that, he began telling people that he was a \u2018starseed\u2019 which is explained was a benevolent alien sent to help inferior species such as human beings.Doctors have suggested that this kind of claim fits in with a preliminary diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. The symptoms of this mental illness include hallucinations (such as hearing voices) and delusions along with periods of both depression and mania. Sources close to West and his wife Kim Kardashian have suggested that his mental health has been disintegrating for quite some time now. It is believed that this latest episode was triggered by ongoing feelings of guilt and unhappiness about the death of his beloved mother, negative reviews about his fashion line Yeezy and the brutal robbery of his wife in Paris some months previously.However, some believe that West\u2019s mental health issues are not as clear-cut as they might appear to be. West was admitted to hospital last month after two incidents where he made controversial speeches on stage during his tour. The first incident came when he said that he would have voted for Donald Trump because he believed that it would bring racism to the surface of American society meaning that it would be impossible to ignore anymore. A few nights later he claimed that the rapper Jay-Z was a member of the Illuminati and said that he had been hurt by his wife, Beyonce. In this speech he said; \u201cI am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk, when I talk to y\u2019all like this\u2026Jay Z, I know you got killers, please don\u2019t send them at my head.

As researchers work to unravel the complexities of the interactions of the foods we eat, we present you with the most powerful food synergies currently known to science.\nTomatoes are rich in lycopene, a pigment-rich antioxidant known as a carotenoid, which reduces cancer risk and cardiovascular disease. Fats make carotenoids more bioavailable, a fact that makes a strong case for adding tomatoes to your guacamole. \u201cThis also has a Mediterranean cultural tie-in,\u201d says registered dietitian Susan Bowerman of California Polytechnic State University. \u201cThe lycopene in tomato products such as pasta sauce is better absorbed when some fat (e.g., olive oil) is present than if the sauce were made fat free.\u201d This may also explain why we love olive oil drizzled over fresh tomatoes. And when it comes to salads, don\u2019t choose low-fat dressings.

Folate is the naturally occurring form of the water-soluble vitamin B9.

The human body needs folate to synthesize and repair its DNA. It\u2019s especially important during the kind of rapid cell division and growth seen in infancy and pregnancy. Children and adults both require folate to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia among many other vital functions. Folic acid, on the other hand, is synthetically produced, and refers to just one member of the folate group:Pteroylmonoglutamic acid. While folic acid occurs only rarely in whole foods, it\u2019s extremely stable, which is why it\u2019s widely used in dietary supplements and to fortify processed foods. The important thing to remember is that folic acid is not itself biologically active, though for most people the liver can convert it to the folate we need. Most, however, does not mean all.

You Should Read This", "text": "Almost all sanitary napkins and tampons are made with bleached rayon, cotton and plastics, how safe do you think that material is to be inside or very close to your Vagina? Not to mention these products leave behind fibers in your vagina that can cause bladder, vaginal infections, and Toxic Shock Syndrome. Tampons are also known to absorb the natural fluids and bacteria\u2019s that the vagina produces to stay clean and healthy. Let\u2019s look at the #1 ingredient in generic tampons and sanitary napkins: Rayon. Rayon is a fiber that is made from cellulose fibers, cellulose is a natural fiber, but to produce Rayon chemical procedures are needed that include: carbon disulphide, sulfuric acid, chlorine and caustic soda. Side effects from exposure to too much Rayon can include: nausea, vomiting, chest pain, headaches and many others. Rayon is not just found in tampons and pads, but a lot of clothes are made from it as well. Sanitary napkins also contain quite a bit of plastic, which does not allow sufficient air flow \u2018down there\u2019 so in turn can also cause an array of infections. Tampons and pads are also bleached using chlorine, which results in the production of dioxin, which is linked to breast cancer, endometriosis, immune system suppression and various other ailments.A menstrual cup is my first choice for a tampon/ pad alternative. It is a flexible silicone cup that is inserted into the vagina. Essentially this cup catches all the blood and you empty it every 12 hours during your cycle and reinsert it. I know what you are thinking\u2026 gross. That\u2019s what I thought too; my initial thought was that this sounded so disgusting that I would never use it. I guess that changed as I researched all of the positive effects that came from using a cup. If it is properly inserted and taken out there is no reason that you should ever have to actually touch blood, but even if you do, what\u2019s the harm? Just wash your hands, you big baby.\nIt may take a few cycles to get the hang of how to use one of these cups, but once you do you will wish you had started a lot sooner! I recommend that you continue to use pads or liners until you have mastered the insertion technique, just in case. Not only will you save a lot of money using a menstruation cup, but you will be doing a huge favor to the environment as well. Think about it, If an average women uses about 17,000 pads or tampons during her entire menstruation period, x that by 3.5 billion women in the world, and yeah, you do the math\u2026. Another great thing about using menstrual cups is that many women have reported to having less severe cramping during their period! I know that alone would encourage some women to making this change.\u00a0 Some brands of menstrual cups are: \u2018DivaCup,\u2019 \u2018MoonCup,\u2019 \u2018Ladycup\u2019 and \u2018Lunette,\u2019 among many others.", "is_fake": 1},

The only remaining cave houses an intricate network of metal pipes, with diameters as large as 1.5 feet and as small as a toothpick. Dozens of pipes run straight into the mountain, leading who knows where.Some of the archaeologists who visited the site speculated the pipework could have once supplied water to the pyramid. Their theory seems to be supported by a multitude of iron pipes found on the shores of nearby Lake Toson. These ones are also available in a range of lengths and diameters, some reaching above the water surface, others buried below.Intrigued by these out of place artifacts, the Beijing Institute of Geology analyzed the Baigong pipes using a technique called thermoluminescence. This method allowed them to determine when the pipes were last subjected to high temperatures. Analysis showed the pipes must have been crafted 150,000 years ago. And the mystery goes deeper. Analysis performed at a government-operated smeltery was unable to determine the exact composition of of the pipes.

Mr. Tewari showed me a stiff conductor about a foot long which was allowed to rotate at the center and connected at each end with small gauge wire. A magnetic circuit was placed under the conductor. When a current was allowed to flow through the conductor it rotated, due to a torque induced on the conductor according to Flemings Left Hand Rule and standard theory, verified by experiments at the dawn of the electrical age. With a simple rearrangement of the magnetic circuit, the same current produced no rotation \u2013 the torque was cancelled. I later duplicated the setup and experiment on my workbench.

Whether you wear your shoes to exercise, for work, or to just lounge around during the day, your feet are not getting enough air to allow perspiration to evaporate.When your feet begin to sweat, the shoes will act like a sponge and absorb the perspiration. Each day that you wear your shoes, the salts contained in the sweat begin to break down the footwear more easily. When you alternate between one pair of shoes and another each day, you allow the inside of the shoes to air dry, in a sense evaporating the sweat before it has the chance to significantly break down the composition of the shoes. The more shoes that you own and the more you alternate between then, the longer each individual pair of shoes are going to last you.When you wear the same pair of shoes each and every day, you are not allowing them adequate time to air out. Most people who work eight hour a day jobs are dressed and ready hours before work, and usually don\u2019t kick off the shoes until they are home for night, ten or more hours later.

Participants are allowed to read books, Skype, play games, as well as use their phones and computers throughout the duration of the study. Pretty much anything is fair game, so long as you remain in bed, earning a cool $1,200 per week.So what are the exact purposes of these studies? The experiments are designed to find ways of preserving astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of extended space travel. \u201cHead down\u201d bed rest is a good way of simulating travel through zero gravity space. Think about it, zero gravity means zero weight or strain on your muscles. It\u2019s a more accessible way of analyzing the bodily changes that occur during space travel. This study is designed to achieve three core tasks: 1) Understanding how one\u2019s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions. 2) Understanding the impact of one\u2019s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks. 3) Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose. Within the experiment there are two study groups: exercising and non-exercising. While the exercising group will be subject to exercise training (on special equipment to maintain the laying down position), the non-exercising group will remain completely at ease. The entire duration of the study actually lasts between 97 and 105 days, depending on whether you\u2019re a non-exercising or an exercising subject, respectively.For the first 13 days for non-exercising subjects and 21 days for exercising subjects, you\u2019re able to move freely (in and out of bed) within the bed rest facility. However, after this period you will be prohibited from leaving the bed for the next 70 days, aside from a few specified tests, where you must lay with your head back and feet up. Throughout the entire duration of the study, you will be subject to bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s capacity to fight off infections. So is it worth it? Although spending two months in bed would realistically be excruciating, at least you can rest easily knowing you\u2019re making the sacrifice of grueling laziness for the purpose of furthering human space exploration. This is the only time you could claim to have helped send the first astronauts to Mars by doing absolutely nothing but sitting on your ass.", "is_fake": 1},

Hot water can also ripen latent boils, abscesses or skin eruptions and bring them to the surface for release. Hot water also draws the body\u2019s circulation outwards, opening up the pores and capillaries.\u00a0However, prolonged immersion in extremely hot water is not recommended.Hot water hydrotherapy is beneficial because in a reflexive response to external heat, your body creates changes that help keep the body cool, including dilating blood vessels to increase the blood flow, moving blood flow to the extremities and the surface of the skin, opening the pores, stimulating sweat glands and relaxing muscles.", "is_fake": 1},

The god looked around, and realised that there was nothing around him but darkness and chaos, and that he was all alone. Desiring companionship, Atum began the work of creation. In some versions of the myth, Atum masturbated, and through this act, created Shu (the god of air) and Tefnut (the goddess of moisture). In other versions of the story, these deities were created by Atum\u2019s copulation with his own shadow. Shu and Tefnut left Atum on the Benben stone, and went away to create the rest of the world. After some time, Atum is said to have grown worried about his children. Removing his eye, he sent it in search of them. Shu and Tefnut returned with their father\u2019s eye, and the deity, seeing his children return, shed tears of joy. These teardrops, which fell on the Benben stone that Atum was standing on, transformed into human beings.The Benben stone is also recorded to have been a sacred object that was once kept in the special shrine known as the \u2018hwt benben\u2019, which translates as \u2018House of the Benben\u2019. This sacred relic was the innermost sanctuary of the temple in Heliopolis, where Atum once served as its chief deity. The original cult object is said to have been lost at some point of time in history. Nevertheless, based on pictorial evidence, it has been suggested that this was an upright stone with a rounded top. It has also been pointed out that later on, other solar temples would also have their own Benben stones. For example, the temple of Aten in El-Amarna / Akhetaten, that was built by the 18", "is_fake": 1},

How laughable, most of us say, and yet, although there is no proof of these two, the FBI did, in truth, poison liquor stores during Prohibition for the purpose of \u201cdissuading\u201d people from that demon hooch.Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933 in the U. S., and was absolutely unenforceable. Everyone of the public knew perfectly well that a drink now and then was not at all harmful, and refused to accept its absence. Prohibition was impelled by the Temperance Movement, which promoted teetotalism, or utter abstinence from alcohol. Its most prominent activist was Carrie Nation, a 6-foot, 180-pound, blue-haired battle axe, who stormed into bars and smashed their kegs open with a hatchet. Amazingly, no drunks ever beat her up for this.Once Prohibition went into effect, the FBI saw fit to enforce it as well as possible, since the law is the law, and, by adding potentially fatal impurities to it, endeavored to teach the public that it was going to lose with Mr. Booze. These impurities included methane, formaldehyde, ammonia, and even arsenic and kerosene. But the FBI\u2019s usual method, without informing the populace, of course, was to denature drinkable alcohol, which is called ethanol, by adding rubbing alcohol, which is made of water and propene. Propene is distilled from natural gas and oil; rubbing alcohol does a fine job cleaning wounds and preventing infection, but will destroy your intestines, kidneys, and liver if you drink it.

Located on the Yamaki family compound, less than 2 miles from where the bomb exploded, the white pine was miraculously safe from harm as shards of glass exploded through the property because of the blast. Luckily, the tree was unharmed and the Yamaki family didn\u2019t suffer any permanent injuries.First planted in 1625 and originating on Miyajima Island, the bonsai is said to be a valuable tree due to its rarity. Back in 1976, the bonsai master Masaru Yamaki gifted the ornamental tree to the American people as part of Japan\u2019s Bicentennial. It is now a permanent resident of the Japanese Bonsai Collection at the\u00a0National Bonsai & Penjing Museum\u00a0in Washington DC. Coupled with its rich history of survival, the bonsai (the oldest in the collection) attracts many visitors to its new home in America.\u201cEach bonsai has its special quality. Some express changes in the four seasons, while others express the elegance of nature in a pot. Bonsai is not limited to expensive trees in a classic shape. Indeed, by using excessive wire or growing unnecessary branches in order to create a classic shape, the artist may fail to express the tree\u2019s essential beauty.", "is_fake": 1},

About 100 million years ago, a rising column of magma brought this material near to the surface where it exploded in a large volcano creating an 80-acre crater and blanketing the surrounding landscape with ejecta. Within the ejecta were many fragments of mantle rock that were carried up to the surface with the rising magma. These fragments are known as \u201cxenoliths\u201d and they contained the diamonds.Atmospheric weathering over the years eroded away the ejecta and leaving the stable and very resistant diamonds in the soil.

Like the Mona Lisa, the picture is so commonly parodied and depicted on T-shirts and postcards as to have become a piece of kitsch. However, what almost everyone has missed is the hidden message that Micheloangelo inserted: a human brain dissimulated in the figure of God.Although the Creation of Adam was painted around 1511, it is not until 1990 that Frank Lynn Meshberger, a physician in Anderson, Indiana, publicly noted in the Journal of the American Medical Association that the figures and shapes that make up the figure of God also make up an anatomically accurate figure of the human brain. Take a close look at the picture above and you will see the Sylvian fissure that divides the frontal lobe from the parietal and temporal lobes: it is represented by a bunching up of the cape by one of the angels and by a fold in God\u2019s tunic. The bottom-most angel that appears to support the weight of God is the brainstem, and his trailing scarf the vertebral artery. The foot of another angel is the pituitary gland, and his bent knee the optic chiasm where the optic nerves from the eyes partially cross over. The ingenuity and level of detail is simply staggering, and a lasting testament to Michelangelo\u2019s extraordinary\u2014and, for the time, very unusual\u2014knowledge of human anatomy.Some have gone so far as to argue that the point at which the finger of God and the finger of Adam touch represents the synaptic cleft across which neurons communicate by means of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. However, the concept of bioelectricity only dates from the 18th century, when Luigi Galvani demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve leads to twitching of the leg muscles. And it is not until 1921 that Otto Loewi discovered the first neurotransmitter (acetylcholine, which he called \u2018Vagusstoff\u2019), and thereby earned himself a Nobel Prize.

The scientific process that envelops the study of fingerprints in light of behavioral and psycho-analytical aspects is called dermatoglyphics analysis. By closely examining our own prints we can determine certain aspects about our personalities that are commonly associated with the three main fingerprint types; curves, loops, and swirls. Below is a breakdown of the different traits and attributes that are associated with each one. All you need to do is look closely at your finger print patterns and compare them against choices 1, 2, and 3 to see what they reveal.People who have lines which curve in a similar fashion to the picture of type one above are full of energy and always busy. Those with curved prints love and appreciate music and art, and they are very loyal friends who never give up on those close to them. This also corresponds to being extremely confident in terms of one\u2019s self and everything they do. In fact, they naturally ooze confidence and self-assurance so much that it shows in how they move, walk, and hold themselves. They make up their mind quickly and always stick with what they think is best. While that can be a positive attribute, it can get them into trouble from time to time, and they often struggle to see things from someone else\u2019s perspective.Those who have loops in their prints, like type two, tend to be very calm, serene, laid back and relaxed people. They are warm and open, often empathizing with others, and easily make friends. Even though they are responsible to the fullest degree, they barely ever make a first move or take initiative, instead preferring to let others take the lead. In addition, if they find work to be tedious or boring they will lose all interest in it and be depressed until they switch it up.

So that explains things for\u00a0women who have given birth to sons.

In the study, they took samples from 120 women who had never had sons. They found that 21% of these women had male DNA. The women were then categorized into 4 groups according to pregnancy history: Group A had only daughters, Group B had had one or more miscarriage(s), Group C had induced abortions, and Group D had never been pregnant before. The prevalence of male michrochimerism was considerably greater in Group C, although it was still present in each group: Group A 8%, Group B 22%, Group C 57%, and Group D 10%.The conclusions of this study noted that the possible sources of male michrochimerism included known pregnancies, miscarriages, vanished male twins, or sexual intercourse.

The agents could not help themselves as they were tempted in South America, but unfortunately it costed them their entire careers and public shame. This is one secret they probably wish was never revealed.In 2015, two senior agents collided an official government vehicle into a barrier at the White House while inebriated.

The company leveraged its Nazi Party connections to continuously enhance its business relationship with Hitler\u2019s Reich, in Germany and throughout Nazi-dominated Europe.Dehomag and other IBM subsidiaries custom-designed the applications. Its technicians sent mock-ups of punch cards back and forth to Reich offices until the data columns were acceptable, much as any software designer would today. Punch cards could only be designed, printed, and purchased from one source: IBM. The machines were not sold, they were leased, and regularly maintained and upgraded by only one source: IBM. IBM subsidiaries trained the Nazi officers and their surrogates throughout Europe, set up branch offices and local dealerships throughout Nazi Europe staffed by a revolving door of IBM employees, and scoured paper mills to produce as many as 1.5 billion punch cards a year in Germany alone. Moreover, the fragile machines were serviced on site about once per month, even when that site was in or near a concentration camp.

The endless stream of creams, lotions, tonics, diets, treatments, and more are proof of this and while they often promise the world, they rarely ever deliver. Rather than wasting your time and hard earned money on some disappointing product that was marketed specifically towards you, try ice point therapy. It\u2019s an easy, all-natural, and affordable approach to optimizing your health and well-being. Here\u2019s how to do it:Gather together an ice cube and a towel then begin by laying flat on your stomach. Find a comfortable position and relax before placing the towel under your head and chin. Next, place the ice cube on the back of your neck at the base of your skull and if you need a better idea of exactly where to situate it, refer to the accompanying video. Allow the ice cube to sit there and slowly melt for at least 20 minutes and then use the towel to clean up the water. Ice point therapy works best when it\u2019s done every day in the morning on an empty stomach, and again in the evening right before you go to bed.This alternative healing method has been practiced for thousands of years. It\u2019s derived from ancient Chinese medicine and is related closely to acupuncture and acupressure. The precise point that it revolves around, where your head and neck meet at the base of your skull, is known as the Feng Fu point. When ice is applied to the point it has an energizing effect.

The most common manifestation of pyogenic granuloma, found in children and young adults, is a solitary red nodule that appears on the hands, face, neck, or upper trunk. Some people develop several lesions located near each other. The lesions grow rapidly after appearance, to reach their full size in a matter of weeks, after which they stop growing. The average diameter is 6.5 mm, but cases of lesions as large as 25 cm have been reported. A variant of the condition that often affects pregnant women occurs in the tissues lining the mouth. In some rare cases, multiple lesions can appear all over the hands, arms, and trunk. The lesions easily break open and bleed, and therefore, can turn into black, crusty ulcerated lesions.\nOther than lesions that develop during pregnancy, the cause of pyogenic granuloma is unclear. Many lesions seem to occur at the sites of prior trauma. Some experts speculate that trauma stimulates an abnormal angiogenesis pathway, inducing the production of large numbers of abnormal capillaries at the site. Some patients being treated with anti-cancer or antiviral drugs develop pyogenic granulomas.\nThese lesions are most common in children around the age of six, and in adults in their 20s. They affect around 0.5% of pregnancies. However, they may arise in individuals of any age.", "is_fake": 1},

Studies show it increases the amount of insulin available in people with diabetes and thus helps regulate the amount of glucose in the blood. Other associated benefits are that it improves impotence, prevents yeast infections, helps our bodies absorb minerals, cleans and reduces fatty build up in the liver, acts as a natural antibiotic, and protects against osteoarthritis.

By doing this, the nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants in the garlic are taken up by your body and absorbed into the bloodstream.

{"date": 2018, "title": "These Are The Ten Worst Fake Foods For Your Health", "text": "You may be thinking that you eat crab in crab sticks, but this name is misleading. Crab sticks are actually manufactured from a processed seafood made of finely cheap pulverized white fish flesh (called surimi), with different edible additions (crab extract, crab flavor, seasonings etc). Surimi is available in many shapes, forms and textures, and is often used to imitate the texture and color of the meat of lobster, crab, and other shellfish. In crab sticks it is shaped to resemble leg meat of a crab. It enables food manufacturers to take cheap fish and upgrade it to a taste of the most expensive fish meats such as crab or lobster. This could have been worse as fish is considered good for us, but still it\u2019s not a crab and it\u2019s still a highly processed product with many additives. The assortment of additives may include other fish products, but it is usually egg whites, oils, salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and various starches and gums to create the expected texture.Easy Cheese is the trademark for a processed cheese product also referred to spray cheese or cheese in a can, and is a descendant of squeeze cheese packaged in a squeezable plastic tube. This product was created for people who like to eat cheese but can\u2019t be bothered to get a knife and slice it for consumption. It comes packaged in a pressurized can, much like canned whipped cream and does not require refrigeration. Whereas cheese is made from handful of ingredients, Easy Cheese contains many additives such as whey protein concentrate, canola oil, milk protein concentrate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, calcium phosphate, lactic acid, sorbic acid, sodium alginate, apocarotenal, annatto, cheese culture and enzymes.Cheez Whiz is a thick processed cheese sauce or spread, and many refer to it as \u2018pseudo-cheese\u2019. The yellow paste usually comes in a glass jar and is used as a topping for cheesesteaks, corn chips, hot dogs and other foods. The advantage of it is that it\u2019s more spreadable and melts better than natural cheese.\u00a0 A single serving, which is defined as just two level tablespoons, contains nearly a third of a day\u2019s recommended maximum of saturated fat as well as a third of the maximum sodium recommended for most of American adults. The problem is that if you sit in front of the TV and start dipping your crackers in it, it\u2019s hard to stick to only 2 tablespoons. Also there are so many items listed in this product, starting with the watery by-product of milk called whey, canola oil, corn syrup, and an additive called milk protein concentrate, which manufacturers had begun importing from other countries as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive powdered milk produced by American dairies.

The simple act of applying focused pressure to various points on our bodies does wonders to dissolve away aches, pains, tension, and built up stresses that are bogging us down. Acupressure works by stimulating the thousands of nerves in the body, thereby increasing blood flow. Human feet alone have over 15,000 nerves and they all connect to form a network that reaches different areas of the body, like the main organs and glands. Many have found that by using simple acupressure massage techniques at home they could dramatically relieve pain and discomfort caused by common ailments. People have successfully treated their migraines, headaches, back pain, digestion and sleep issues, and more by massaging different body points associated with the area in which the problem stems from.One such point is found on the hands and it\u2019s primarily used to help relieve pain and discomfort stemming from headaches and migraines. The point is located right above the webbing between the thumb and index fingers on each hand. To activate it, press firmly down on the point while massaging and rotating in a circular or back and forth motion for at least 30 seconds and up to a couple of minutes at a time. Make sure you are relaxed and comfortable, sit back and close your eyes, and breathe evenly in and out. This may be done anywhere at anytime of the day and it can be repeated however many times you\u2019d like. The accompanying video shows you exactly where and how this self-massage should be done and it also demonstrates a number of other pressure points that can be used for headache relief.There are many additional acupressure treatments that are incredibly simple, convenient, easy to do, and don\u2019t cost you a penny if done in the comfort of your home. If you\u2019re hesitant or doubtful about whether or not acupressure could help you, try thinking about it like this; you have nothing to lose and potentially lots to gain by giving yourself a hand massage.

According to the report, many of the vegetables that are widely available today are grown using this method. The absorbent foam plugs that come with the Ikea system enable the seeds to sprout and then proceed to keep the seeds moist without over-watering them. Following the germination of the seeds, all that needs to be done is to transfer the entire foam plug into its own separate small pot and fill it with pumice stones, which can retain a lot of water.The pots can then be transferred to a growing tray that is equipped with a solar lamp, which will provide the plants with enough nourishment to last all year round. The system is so efficient that it can even be successful in rooms without any sunlight, although they can be placed on a windowsill that gets a lot of sun if it is convenient. The growing tray is additionally equipped with a built-in water sensor, which ensures that the plants are given the perfect amount of water. Helena Karl\u00e9n, from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, said, \u201cThe challenge was to make growing plants in a hydroponic system simple so that anyone could succeed\u2026\u201dNamed in the KRYDDA/V\u00c4XER series, the design was born out of a collaboration with agricultural scientists in Sweden, with a target audience of those who live in apartments or don\u2019t have a garden, as well as people who want completely fresh produce even during the cold winter months. Whilst the system is not the first indoor hydroponic system, it is a more affordable option than most, and ideal for those with minimal space.

Since the human body already contains a built-in endogenous cannabinoid system, complete with cannabinoid receptors, inputting CBD from marijuana can help normalize the body\u2019s functional systems, including cell communication and proper immune function.The way CBDs work is that they bridge the gap of neurotransmission in the central nervous system, including in the brain, by providing a two-way system of communication that completes a positive \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d according to Dr. William Courtney, a medical marijuana expert and founder of Cannabis International. As opposed to a one-way transmission, which can promote chronic inflammation of healthy tissue, the unique two-way transmission system engaged by marijuana CBDs mimics the body\u2019s own natural two-way communications system.So individuals whose systems are compromised by autoimmune disorders, cellular dysfunction, chronic inflammation, cancer cells, and various other illnesses can derive a wide range of health-promoting benefits simply by consuming CBDs.

Some people may have a natural tendency to feel colder. For instance, if you\u2019re the only woman in the room, the thermostat may be set too low for your liking \u2013 women tend to prefer a temperature that\u2019s about 2.5\u00b0C higher than men do.\u00a0If you are skinnier than the next person, that may\u00a0affect you too (more on that later). But if you are perpetually cold even after bundling up in warm clothes or when everyone around is comfortable, or if certain body parts like the hands or feet always stay cold, it\u2019s time to look at\u00a0possible causes.The temperature of your body is regulated by a complex mechanism involving many different systems. The hypothalamus in the brain acts as a kind of internal thermostat, sending out signals to control heat or cool the body down. It also instructs the thyroid gland to decrease or increase metabolism. Your thyroid gland plays a significant role as well, regulating your metabolic rate and overseeing the burning of calories to generate heat and energy. Your body fat helps to maintain body heat while blood flow spreads this heat through the body.\u00a0While people who are in poor health or who suffer from severe chronic illnesses\u00a0may often feel cold more intensely, a problem with any of the body systems in charge of heat can also throw things out of whack and cause cold intolerance. Here are some possibilities you need to explore.If you thought that the worst thing about a sleepless night is a grumpy morning where you\u2019re barely able to function, think again. It can also mess up the way your body temperature is managed. Your body\u2019s regulation of temperature is closely linked to sleep. Studies have found that sleep deprivation increases heat loss from the feet and reduces heat loss from the hands.", "is_fake": 1},

Clearly science has a few priorities to get in order.After some rooting around online, I was able to turf up one fairly detailed study, however. In this research, scientists tried to discover the compounds that give frying bacon its aroma, by comparing it with the aromas released when cooking pork loin. They did this by frying the meat, mincing it, then passing nitrogen gas over it to collect any volatile organic compounds that were being released. The collected volatile compounds were then passed through a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer in order for identification to be carried out.The volatile compounds collected originate in part from the Maillard reaction, in which sugars in the foodstuff are broken down by reaction with amino acids as heating occurs. In bacon, other volatile compounds are produced due to the thermal breakdown of fat molecules. As well as this, in the case of smoked bacon, nitrite used in the curing process can also react with the fatty acids and fats present in bacon on heating \u2013 this leads to a higher percentage of nitrogen-containing compounds than in standard pork meat.", "is_fake": 1},

It had two levels and was surrounded by a galleried courtyard. The upper level was divided into five rooms, which were once decorated with red paint.\u00a0 On top of a platform on this level, archaeologists found numerous burnt bones of lamb, which are possibly associated with sacrifice.The lower level of the temple was riddled with animal bones and pottery fragments, and contained the remains of eight clay platforms, which may have been used as altars.

Also within the temple, archaeologists unearthed small gold ornaments, most-likely used in the hair, bone ornaments, and unusual human-like figurines, which are depicted with beak-like noses and unevenly positioned eyes.Fragments of figurines, some of which look similar to humans, were also found at the temple. Like findings at other Trypillian sites, some of the figurines have noses that look like beaks and eyes that are dissimilar, one being slightly larger than the other. The age and structure of the ancient city, along with the distinctive figurines, link the site to the Trypillian culture (a modern-day name), which is believed to have extended over an area of around 35,000 square kilometers, incorporating parts of present-day Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, between 5400 and 2700 BCE.

Here are 4 ways to get started:Sun exposure kick starts the pineal gland to produce serotonin and stimulates the mind.

That key is Simple Living or the idea of simplifying life in order to shed away what is unnecessary, inauthentic and a hindrance to your life purpose. The concept might seem obvious but somehow hidden none the less. Personal growth, or rather actualising your highest potential and becoming the best version of yourself, requires shedding off and letting go of things which are not authentically in line with your Soul agenda rather than putting in a lot of effort to learn or acquire something else. It\u2019s energy-wasting spending hours, days and weeks trying to relearn habits, boosting your confidence, visualising your goals, improving your creativity, doing soul searching, etc without first simplifying your life. Yes all these things and others are important personal development tools but I have realised that by doing one thing \u2013 engaging in a path of Simple Living \u2013 will make everything else effortless. This is particularly true to your goal of self-actualisation or becoming the best You.So in a way, if we only tried to make life simpler and nothing else, it\u2019s already a hundredfold better than trying hard to do other self-improvement stuff \u2013 some of which perhaps fail, we give up on or take us a lot of persistence and struggle to achieve.

But it is necessary to know how to take care of your body and how to avoid these deadly diseases. Step one: avoid these foods.A disproportionate sugar intake can have a list of consequences. It is believed to heighten risks of type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation. Not to mention it degrades your teeth. Other research indicates that sugars can worsen or even cause acne. Sugar can seem almost impossible to avoid since just about everything has sugar in it. But in terms of moderation and/or avoidance, high sugar products like sodas, fruit drinks, candies, pastries, etc. should be monitored. Some healthy substitutes for sugar include stevia, honey, and blackstrap molasses. And while sugars found in sweet treats is something to avoid, natural sugars in organic fresh and dried fruit are not a matter of the same concern.

A few of these minerals include: sodium chloride, sulphate, calcium, potassium and magnesium. When using this salt, you are actually getting less sodium intake per serving than regular table salt because it is less refined and the pieces are larger. Therefore Himalayan salt has less sodium per serving because the crystals or flakes take up less room than the highly processed table salt variety. Another cool thing about this salt is that because of its cellular structure it stores vibrational energy. The minerals in this salt exist in colloidal form, which means that they are small enough for our cells to easily absorb.Some of the benefits that you can expect by consuming this salt in place of regular table salt include:", "is_fake": 1},

By inhibiting any disturbance from other elevator riders, you could squeeze in a quickie if the building is tall enough.

A small organization called Western Watersheds Project (which I represent pro bono in an unrelated lawsuit) has found the bacteria in a number of streams crossing federal land in concentrations that violate water quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act.

Though the Pentagon won\u2019t say how far along the research is, or even confirm that any efforts are underway, the concept persists. The \u201cU.S. Air Force Transformation Flight Plan,\u201d published by the Air Force in November 2003, references \u201chypervelocity rod bundles\u201d in its outline of future space-based weapons, and in 2002, another report from RAND, \u201cSpace Weapons, Earth Wars,\u201d dedicated entire sections to the technology\u2019s usefulness.If so-called \u201cRods from God\u201d\u2013an informal nickname of untraceable origin\u2013ever do materialize, it won\u2019t be for at least 15 years. Launching heavy tungsten rods into space will require substantially cheaper rocket technology than we have today. But there are numerous other obstacles to making such a system work.

Furthermore, the \u201cabsentee ratio\u201d\u2013the fact that orbiting satellites circle the Earth every 100 minutes and so at any given time might be far from the desired target\u2013would be prohibitive. A better solution, Pike argues, is to pursue the original concept: Place the rods atop intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would slow down enough during the downward part of their trajectory to avoid vaporizing on impact. ICBMs would also be less expensive and, since they\u2019re stationed on Earth, would take less time to reach their targets. \u201cThe space-basing people seem to understand the downside of space weapons,\u201d Pike says\u2013among them, high costs and the difficulty of maintaining weapon platforms in orbit. \u201cBut I\u2019ll still bet you there\u2019s a lot of classified work on this going on right now.\u201dThe first weapon on the list is arguably both the spookiest and the most terrifying from beginning to end.

The fate of the tribes has puzzled and provoked scholars and theologians ever since.Evidence leads to some of the world\u2019s most exotic and extraordinary places, exploring the heart and soul of a mystery that echoes throughout human history. Evidence is documented in remote and sometimes dangerous regions, investigating nearly every story, no matter how seemingly far-fetched. Simcha Jacobovici interviews Taliban before they started their war on the west. Pashtun tribes in Afghanistan have Israelite past and after grasping for power with the help of the British in the 18th Century, they named the country after Afgan son of King Saul of Israel. The journey leads to Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Burma, Manipur, India, China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Tunisia and the Middle East following points along the Silk Road in Central Asia.

Following the tremendous defeat, the Nazis were never able to gain a foothold in the battle against the Soviet Union again. The Russian army who defeated Hitler\u2019s forces in the Second World War realized that the stakes were high, but they probably did not realize the depths to which Hitler and other key figures in the Nazi command were prepared to sink to in their quest to dominate Russia.The Nazi commanders cooked up a plan referred to as Generalplan Ost, or \u201cMaster Plan for the East.\u201d The documents associated with this plan claim that the indigenous Slavic people would be immediately marked for extermination as they were considered to be part of an inferior race. The documents explain that the Nazis would have enslaved the Slavic people or deported them en masse to the Siberian region. Alternatively, the Nazis wrote that they might starve to death as their agricultural output would be swallowed by demand from besieged Germany. Hitler claimed to be particularly concerned about Moscow which he believed could be a center of revolt.Therefore he ordered that if Russia was taken by the Germans, that the capital city should be immediately burned to the ground and the inhabitants were to be massacred. Following that, Hitler ordered that parts of the Moscow-Volga Canal should be destroyed so that the entire city would be flooded and essentially be transformed into a lake.

Other explanations include the belief that humans are just intrinsically awful, blaming minorities like Jews or immigrants, blaming racism and white supremacy, or going all the way down wild and twisted rabbit holes into theories about reptilian secret societies and baby-eating pedophile cabals. But really all of mankind\u2019s irrational behavior can be explained by the basic human impulse to amass power and influence over one\u2019s fellow humans, combined with the fact that sociopaths tend to rise to positions of power.Our evolutionary ancestors were pack animals, and the ability to rise in social standing in one\u2019s pack determined crucial matters like whether one got first or last dibs on food or got to reproduce. This impulse to rise in our pack is hardwired deeply into our evolutionary heritage, but when left unchecked due to a lack of empathy, and when expanded into the globe-spanning 7.6 billion human pack we now find ourselves in due to ease of transportation and communication, it can lead to individuals who will keep amassing more and more power until they wield immense influence over entire clusters of nations.", "is_fake": 1},

The flow of water is carefully controlled and monitored by the workers. The altitude of the ponds slowly decreases, so that the water may flow through the myriad branches of the water-supply channels and be introduced slowly through a notch in one sidewall of each pond.Perched high above the Sacred Valley of the Incas, the salt mined from the ponds of Maras have been highly sought for their healing attributes, rated in the top 10 finest therapeutic salts in the world by Town and Country Magazine. Due to economics, the local population prefer to quarry the salt solely for consumption, thus removing the healing mineral content. It is still quite possible to obtain unprocessed, raw, mineral salt directly from the salt pans.

Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are often the two primary conditions that lead to a diagnosis of COPD, that often overlap. The general worsening of lung disease and resulting damage is the main difference COPD and other respiratory conditions. Chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes.Emphysema is the gradual destruction of the tiny air sacks in the lungs called alveoli that are responsible for oxygenating the blood. Both of these conditions result in a constant shortness of breath, fatigue, and even death. Other conditions that attribute to COPD are bronchiectasis which is characterized by damage and scaring in airways, and asthma \u2013 which is characterized by narrowing of the airways. Both of these conditions can be congenital, but bronchiectasis is often more of an acquired condition. The main causes of COPD are smoking, genetics, and environmental exposure to dust, chemicals, and toxins.Most doctors will tell you that lung tissue cannot be regenerated. A recent study done by Dr. Gloria De Carlo Massaro and Donald Massaro, is proving otherwise. Their recent research, which was done at Georgetown University School of Medicine, found that derivative of vitamin A actually reversed emphysema in rats. The specific compound that was used was all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and it allowed the mice to re-grow healthy alveoli.

The message that most men have received is that this is a time to stay away \u2014 a time when woman is erratic and moody, and best avoided \u2014 and have come to believe that is what is expected of them at this sacred time. These loving men, with so much to offer and the best of intentions, have learned that the best way they can support their woman is to create distance, both physically and emotionally, during the bleeding time of a woman\u2019s cycle. It comes to pass that this time feels like a curse, not only to her, but to him. The menstrual cycle and anything associated with it feels like women\u2019s business alone, a mystery that men are kept from knowing.Let\u2019s look at it from a different perspective. Menstruation is not simply a period of bleeding, followed and preceded by longer periods of \u2018normal\u2019. Instead all of the women in your life are cycling every month on a journey through the four seasons. For most women this cycle turns around every 28 days, with each season representing about a week. So when the woman in your life is bleeding, she is in the winter of her cycle. During this time, as in the winter, there is a sense of darkness and looking inward. When we are in a dark room, our other senses become more highly tuned and this is how it is for a woman in the winter of her cycle. She is experiencing a far more sensorily stimulated existence, so noise, touch, and changes in her environment are more impactful and disturb her equilibrium more than at other times. The bleeding woman is open to the world, ready to receive messages and insights and is deeply sensitive to her intuition.During this bleeding time, it\u2019s vital to understand that woman is not only releasing the uterine wall of her uterus. She is also releasing the build of of energies that no longer serve from the previous cycle. If you are in a sexual relationship with a woman, then she is also bleeding and releasing any distortions and energies that have imprinted themselves within her womb. When a woman opens her body to you, this is a divine gift that you can honour by coming to her clean in your energy, honouring her with the purity of your love. In a bigger sense, she is also bleeding the distortion of the world\u2019s psyche through her body. This is the gift of woman in her fullest, most sacred capacity, in her divinity. Through bleeding and shedding from her body, she is purifying the psyche of the world, letting go of what has arisen through a cycle that is now ready to be released. In that sense she is serving not only herself and your relationship, but also the world.", "is_fake": 1},

Quite often we engage in things that may not bring us happiness but just fill the emptiness of our lives. You might think that just living is enough when in reality, it is far from the truth.No one comes with an ultimate purpose or way to live. We all grow and learn and figure out what is the best way to utilize the life that has been given to us and if you think you are not happy with it, then it is your soul trying to tell that you need a break. Here is a list of things that are often marked as the reason for the slow death of your soul.We are humans and we are bound to make mistakes. Even our ancestors learned how to survive because of their mistakes. But the thing where most people go wrong is when they do not learn from their mistakes. Your soul starts to deteriorate when you start blaming yourself for a mistake that you have committed. Instead, what you can do is accept the mistake that you have made and see what can be done so that it is not repeated again. Your soul grows with you, mistakes and otherwise.", "is_fake": 1},

So when it comes to decorating, it is important to choose wisely.In order to have a beautiful home, you do not have to worry about trends. Color trends will come and go. The people who live in a home make it beautiful by choosing colors that reflect their likes and their personalities. The trick is to blend those colors you like into a pleasing combination. Choosing color combinations is one of the most intimidating steps for beginners. Color has the power to change the shape and size of furnishings as well as the shape and size of the room itself.

This TED talk is one of the most viewed TED talks of all time and \u00a0has inspired many to re-think the way we are educating our children.

Acidic blood is the root of cancer cells survival. The disease literally feeds off of the glucose human bodies are ingesting every single day and thriving in the environment we create for it. If our bodies maintain a slightly alkaline environment the cells will die off and your body will be cured of cancer and other potential diseases. Doctors prescribe chemotherapy, radiation or heavy drugs to treat cancer. This is counter intuitive, as it adds to the acidity of our body. So while cancer cells might die in the process, healthy cells will die as well and the body is even more susceptible. The most effective and healthy method for eliminating cancer, or potential risk, is diet change.pH stands for power of hydrogen, it is a scale to rate a substance as either 0-7 (acidic) or 7-14 (alkaline). If your body maintains a pH level of 7.5 or above, cancer literally cannot survive. Cancer is a metabolic disease that manifests through poor diet. Basically, the cells of this disease eat glucose and breathe acid. Glucose is most commonly known as sugar. Most things we eat on a daily basis are actually quite acidic and process in our bodies as glucose.

There are other stones, as well as caves, around the Inga stone which also have carvings on them, however they are not of the same intricate level of craftsmanship or style as the Inga. Archeologist and researcher Gabriele Baraldi stumbled upon his first Inga cave in the year 1988 \u2013 after which several more were found. In total, Baraldi has examined up to 497 symbols across all the cave\u2019s walls. Most of the Inga\u2019s carvings are obscure, but a few of them are undoubtedly representative of celestial features, with two being almost identical to the Milky Way and constellation of Orion.Others are thought to be animals, fruits, weapons, human shapes, ancient (or imagined) aircraft or birds, or a crude \u201ctable of contents\u201d of stories divided into sections with each symbol connected to the number of a chapter. Fr. Ignatius Rolim, Professor of Greek and Latin Theology, argued the symbols were similar to ancient Phoenician carvings, and was among the first to argue this theory. Other researchers felt the symbols were related to ancient runes, and still more asserted their similarity in complexity and linear arrangement to a possible short piece of religious scripture. Another researcher, Austrian-born Ludwig Schwennhagen, studied Brazilian history in the early twentieth century and found strong connections in appearance from the Inga symbols to not only the Phoenicians but also the demotic writings (linked more closely to business or literary document-style writings) of the ancient Egyptians. Further groups found a remarkable similarity of the carvings of Inga to the aboriginal artwork found on Easter Island.A closer evaluation of each symbol was the task of some ancient historians, such as author and researcher Roberto Salgado de Carvalho. The concentric circles carved may be related to phallic imprints, while the spiral shapes might signify \u201ctranscosmological shifts or travel\u201d, likely due to shamanic trances/altered states of consciousness or otherwise ingested hallucinogens, while the \u201cU\u201d shapes could mean a uterus/vagina, rebirth or an entrance/door, according to Salgado de Carvalho. The series of symbols in this respect could therefore signal an ancient formula carved onto the Inga, possibly used for accessing a \u201cdoor to the supernatural world,\u201d Salgado de Carvalho suggests. Others have drawn connections to the laws of exogamy at the time. Potholes, also filled with the carvings, found near the Inga are thought to have a connection to early civilizations\u2019 belief that the first mythical people arose from such shapes in the ground. Some have speculated an even more complicated hypothesis that the symbols are actually drawn upside-down and coded purposely for additional secrecy. Others have pondered the possibility that the ancient carvings were a warning to future civilizations of an approaching (or possibly recently survived) worldwide disaster, through which the ancients had briefly retained technology from an earlier existence. In addition, the possible appearance of more than one language being carved on the stone brings another realm of possibility into question.", "is_fake": 1},

Most people also eat copious amounts of food that promote acidity, which in turn makes them more prone to disease.What most people fail to realize is that their bodies are constantly trying to achieve a state of equilibrium at a pH of about 7.365, which is slightly alkaline. To do this, the body draws from the nutrients you put into it via food, which either acidifies or alkalizes the blood. When there are not enough nutrients to maintain this slightly alkaline state, the body draws from backup nutrient reserves in the bones and other places. \u00a0 When these backups run dry, the body\u2019s internal biological terrain becomes a hotbed for chronic disease, which is right about the time the mainstream medical system begins rolling out the drugs. A much simpler solution; though, at least for most people, is to simply switch up their diets and begin to incorporate more alkaline-forming foods\u00a0into their everyday meals.As you may have already guessed, most of the foods that people eat today \u2014 refined grains, pasteurized dairy, conventional meat, vegetable oils, artificial sweeteners, and processed sugars \u2014 are acid-forming foods.

There was no biological affinity among\u00a0all these people, but only the difference in the level of social relations between them. The study showed that, on average, every person had a more similar DNA with his friends than with strangers. The researchers noted that this finding has to do with the tendency of people to make friends with similar racial (and hence genetic) background.The genetic similarity between friends was greater than the expected similarity between people who share a common national and genetic inheritance. It is not clear yet by what mechanisms this occurs. But how similar are we with our friends? On average, according to the study, a friend of ours has a genetic affinity comparable to our fourth cousin, which means that we share about 1% of our genes our friends. \u201c1% does not sound a big deal, but it is for geneticists.It is noteworthy that most people do not even know who their fourth cousins \u200b\u200bare, but somehow, from\u00a0the countless possible cases, we choose to make\u00a0friends with people who are genetically similar to us,\u201d said Prof\u00a0Christakis.

China is telling Muslims that if you want to fast Ramadan, it is fine, but if you want to push your revolution, then a\u00a0Ramadan-ban is added as a bonus punishment.In these troubled regions, China has added several bonus-punishments and banned all Muslim civil servants, Muslim students and Muslim teachers, especially in the Xinjiang province with a large Muslim population in the northwest, from fasting during Ramadan. In addition to the ban on fasting, China has ordered restaurants to stay open all day during Ramadan. \u201cFood service workplaces will operate normal hours during Ramadan,\u201d a notice posted on the website of the state Food and Drug Administration said.

This fluid, called interstitial fluid, provides nutrients and oxygen for the tissues as it flows throughout the body. In response to this generosity, the cells throw their garbage and waste products out for the interstitial fluid to pick up on its way back to the bloodstream. Luckily the interstitial fluid doesn\u2019t mind this treatment and carries this waste back home to the capillaries where 90% of it is reabsorbed. The remaining 10% contains particles too large to pass through the capillary walls, so the lymph system swoops in and sucks it up. With the transfer to a new system in the body, the fluid also gets a name change. Now called lymph, this fluid filters through the lymph nodes and finishes its odyssey back where it started \u2013 in the bloodstream.This process is critical, as the pile-up of waste in the cells can kill them. Without a flowing lymph system, fluid builds up and the body is unable get rid of waste. The waste and fluid itself can cause tissues in the body to swell and can lead to cancer, painfully enlarged organs, or infections throughout the body.A properly working lymphatic system is a great ally to have in boosting the immune system. The spleen removes dead cells and foreign invaders from the body. If you were lucky enough to keep your tonsils, these strategically placed lymph nodes provide a line of defense against possible throat infections. Adenoids are lymph nodes in the nasal cavity that minimize the effect of harmful pathogens entering the body. Perhaps the best evidence for the beneficial effects on the immune system due to lymph nodes is their command of lymphocytes, otherwise known as the all-mighty white blood cell.

A lot of the time, this includes pointing out a silver lining in the situation but it\u2019s not always a helpful thing to do.Empathy is harder to accomplish for many reasons. We not only have to actively listen to another person\u2019s problem without judgement but then be honest with ourselves and the the other person about our feelings as a listener. That connection builds bridges that enforce trust and understanding that are healthy and positive for both people. At a later time it may be appropriate to look for a solution. Nothing in the world makes me feel better than when trusted family or friends understand where I\u2019m standing. It makes me feel better because it verifies where I actually stand, I frequently get lost in my life.Next time someone opens up to you about a problem, try to listen to what they are saying. They are reaching out for help and full acknowledgement is the first step. I know its hard to willingly put yourself through more unnecessary pain but it in doing so you will both feel better. Identifying similar feeling in similar situations strengthens healthy bonds for not only the two of you but the community at whole.

In the region between Calcutta and Madras, the Kalingan\u2019s resisted the imperial rule, leading to an all-out war.

His efforts contributed to Buddhism\u2019s later rise in China, Nepal, Tibet, and Mongolia. Ashoka was a sworn vegetarian but did not force others to do likewise. Indeed, he was incredibly tolerant of other religious sects. He did, however, prohibit the consumption of alcohol.Most importantly, \u201che renounced the idea of trying to integrate the rebellious people, declaring that the only true conquest was to win men\u2019s hearts by observance of the laws of duty and piety, because the Sacred Majesty desired that all living creatures should enjoy security, peace and happiness and be free to live as they pleased\u201d (Pauwels and Bergier). So committed was the Emperor to this mission that he sought to prevent his fellow man from putting their intelligence towards perpetrating evil, particular the evil involved with warfare. The task of collecting, preserving, and containing all knowledge was too great for one emperor to do alone, not the least because of the other duties required by ruling an empire.

An Italian NGO, Legambiente, suspects that about 40 ships loaded with toxic and radioactive waste have disappeared in Mediterranean waters since 1994. If true, these allegations paint a worrying picture of an unknown amount of nuclear waste in the Mediterranean whose true danger will only become clear when the hundreds of barrels degrade or somehow otherwise break open. The beauty of the Mediterranean Sea may well be concealing an environmental catastrophe in the making.The Italian mafia organization just mentioned has not just stayed in its own region when it comes to this sinister business. There are also allegations that Somalian waters and soil, unprotected by government, have been used for the sinking or burial of nuclear waste and toxic metals \u2014 including 600 barrels of toxic and nuclear waste, as well as radioactive hospital waste. Indeed, the United Nations\u2019 Environment Program believes that the rusting barrels of waste washed up on the Somalian coastline during the 2004 Tsunami were dumped as far back as the 1990s.

If it doesn\u2019t accurately picture the truth about the death of our savior, then why do we keep the observance at all?\u00a0The meaning of Easter is Jesus Christ\u2019s victory over death. His resurrection symbolizes the eternal life that is granted to all who believe in Him. The meaning of Easter also symbolizes the complete verification of all that Jesus preached and taught during His three-year ministry. If He had not risen from the dead, if He had merely died and not been resurrected, He would have been considered just another teacher or Rabbi.

The ceasefire agreement called for Russia to influence the Syrian government forces to stop fighting for control and for the US to influence rebel groups to separate from terrorist groups Al Nusra and Islamic State so they could be targeted by joint US-Russia military campaigns, a task which the US has failed to do since February 2016 despite US officials claiming to be in daily contact with rebel groups. The increased tension comes as the United States loses leverage in negotiations because of advances the Syrian government forces have made in regaining control over the country with the support of Russian military.New information about the Syria proxy war continues show that actions by the United States have helped Al Qaeda and the Islamic State gain power in the country, with the goal of allowing the terrorists to overthrow the Syrian government. Evidence for this claim has been reported in small anecdotes by many international media outlets during the violent proxy war which has lasted almost six years, but American reporter Serena Shim dedicated her professional career to proving the United States and allies were purposely helping Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Serena Shim is an American citizen of Lebanese descent who was born near Detroit.

Unfortunately, paper industries use chlorine and chlorine dioxide to bleach it.

Low levels of exposure have been linked to many health problems such as cancer, hormone imbalances (dioxin is a hormone disruptor),\u00a0 immune system impairments, reduced fertility and birth defects. Dioxins cannot be excreted by our bodies, so they just accumulate over time creating a very dangerous situation. Many studies have found correlations between high workplace exposure to dioxins and a increased risk of cancer.

It does little to prevent tooth decay but does a great job destroying your thyroid gland, metabolism, and increasing your risk of cancer and sterility. Toothpaste that contains toxic ingredients, such as fluoride and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), will usually have warning labels on the back of its tube.

So, how could multiple ancient cultures, spanning both years and geography, have strikingly similar creation myths and cosmologies? Why do the Dogon of Africa and the civilizations of ancient Egypt, India, Tibet, and China share sacred words and symbols? Revealing the existence of a long-forgotten primal culture and the world\u2019s first center of higher learning, Laird Scranton shows how the sophisticated complex at Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is the definitive point of origin from which all the great civilizations of the past inherited their cosmology, esoteric teachings, and civilizing skills, such as agriculture, metallurgy, and stone masonry, fully developed.Scranton explains how the carved images on Gobekli Tepe\u2019s stone pillars were the precursors to the sacred symbols of the Dogon, Egyptians, Tibetans, and Chinese as well as the matriarchal Sakti cult of ancient Iran and India. He identifies Gobekli Tepe as a remote mountain sanctuary of higher knowledge alluded to in Sakti myth, named like an important temple in Egypt, and defined in ancient Buddhist tradition as Vulture Peak. Scranton reveals how Gobekli Tepe\u2019s enigmatic \u201cH\u201d carvings and animal symbolism, symbolic of stages of creation, was presented as a kind of prototype of written language accessible to the hunter-gathers who inhabited the region.

Protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) appendix as well as the US Endangered Species Act, populations of the yellow-spotted Amazon River turtle have been in decline for years. Conservationists hope this massive release will change all that.The baby turtles were conceived in the wild and, in order to give them a better chance at survival, volunteers and employees from SERNANP collected the eggs in August. They were then incubated in man-made habitats for 70 days, the same amount of time they would remain in their underground nests in the wild. Turtle eggs are a target for hungry predators desperate for an easy meal, so nests are often raided leaving few, if any, eggs to reach maturity.So far, around 17,000 turtles have been released. Two more phases will bring the grand total to around 500,000 baby turtles, who will live out the rest of their natural lives in the wild and hopefully reproduce successfully, securing a stronger future for the at-risk species.", "is_fake": 1},

If someone tries to hurt you verbally, it is highly possible that they are suffering deep down in their heart. Think about it, if a person is confident, mentally strong, does what they love and is happy with their life, would they ever think about dragging someone down? No, they won\u2019t because strong people uplift others, they will always try to help a person rather than make one feel miserable. So next time someone tries to insult you, don\u2019t take it personally. But if you are really influenced by the critic\u2019s words, talk it over with a close friend or a relative, let it all out and most importantly, forgive yourself for allowing that person to make you feel bad about yourself.We are living in a fast paced world where everyone is always on the run. We are programmed to think that being always busy is something to be proud of. But haven\u2019t we already crossed the borders? The line between business and insanity is thin. Many of us have forgotten that taking a rest is needed for our well-being. Some have almost forgotten how to relax and are always carrying the burden of their busy lives by constantly thinking about work and different everyday tasks. \u00a0It is essential for our health to give ourselves some time off. This will not only improve quality of our life\u00a0but also the quality of our\u00a0work. Taking small breaks every hour while working gives us the opportunity to freshen up and recharge.Many people don\u2019t really know how exactly their daily routine affects their thoughts. They are so used to the activities they do on a daily basis that they forget to stop and reflect on them. Many of us forget to ask ourselves whether the rituals we do today are actually a source of positive energy or the reason for our suffering.", "is_fake": 1},

The key is that it is not about finding great Forex strategies. It is rather about becoming experienced at trading with a system that you use consistently. A trading system might be great but it will not be of any use unless you trade effectively. People tend to blame the Forex strategies they use for failing but the problem actually lies in not trading consistently.This is reason behind the failures of most traders. You have to be very disciplined for sticking to trades and systems without emotions like greed and fear entering your trading decisions. If human emotions are allowed to play a part in trade, the trading system gets altered and so do the results. If you have the wrong emotions for trading, your trading would then be altered negatively. This has often resulted in profitable Forex strategies turning into losers. Another issue with trading in Forex is that the market moves 24/7. It is advantageous in many ways but can also be disadvantageous.
