There is a lot of confusion when people talk about \u201ccholesterol levels\u201d and it\u2019s important to understand that you don\u2019t actually have cholesterol in your blood. \u00a0In order for cholesterol to be transported around the body in our blood and blood vessels, it has to be carried around by special little proteins called lipoproteins which are made in the liver. There are different types of lipoproteins that are classified according to their density. \u00a0You may be familiar with the two most important lipoproteins in regards to cardiovascular disease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). uses a great analogy of cars on a highway to get an understanding of how lipoproteins impact heart disease. If you imagine your bloodstream is like a highway, \u00a0the lipoproteins are taxis that carry the cholesterol, triglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants around your body to your cells and tissues.

What few people realize is that since the USDA authorized commercial release of GMO soy and maize for animal and human feed in 1996, most meat sold in supermarkets, not only in the USA, but across the EU contains animals fed not on open grass fields, but on mixes of GMO soya and maize.EU labeling laws require a product to state if it contains more than 0.9 percent GMO products, but the EU Commission, under lobbying pressure from the giant US grain cartel\u2014Bunge, ADM, Cargill\u2014 granted a giant loophole that allows EU food to be contaminated with huge amounts of GMO. Imported animal feed containing GMO soya or maize is exempt from labeling. Because most livestock and poultry in the EU today, as in the USA, is raised in industrial mass concentrated feeding confinements, and are fed a mix, typically, of Monsanto GMO maize and soya, GMO enters the human diet in considerable portions.", "is_fake": 1},

Originally designed as a way of warding off invading ships, Da Vinci\u2019s diving suit would allow men to engage in a little underwater sabotage by cutting holes in the bottom of the enemy\u2019s hull. Unfortunately, the design, complete with breathing hose and glass goggles, wasn\u2019t needed at the time and would only find itself submerged in planning stages.For those of you who have spent a good amount of time clocking up hours on Assassin\u2019s Creed, you might recognize this next astounding invention. The flying machine, otherwise known as the \u2018Ornithopter\u2019, took its inspiration from bats and birds. Da Vinci designed a machine where the pilot lay down in the center and pedaled a crank, connected to a rod-and-pulley system, to get the machine moving. Once in the air, the wings were designed to flap, much like a bird\u2019s. Sadly, the necessary tools to bring the apparatus into flight were not available at the time, and the machine\u2019s flying days were spent less like a falcon and more like an ostrich.Given his assemblage of homemade artillery, Da Vinci\u2019s hatred of war and \u201ckilling machines\u201d seems a bit counterintuitive.

Copper is known to scientists and the medical community as having anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory properties which can help in first aid to speed up recovery times and heal wounds. Copper is also a necessary part of our diet and our bodies use it to produce new cells and to thrive. It helps strengthen our immune systems and if you drink water which has sat in copper for several hours it can greatly improve, and heal, parts of your digestive system.A few of the basic points you should know are that it is most beneficial to store water overnight in a copper pitcher or bowl. If the water sits for less than four hours in the copper it may not take on all of the positive qualities and won\u2019t be as good for your health. Also, to get the most out of copper infused water you should aim to drink it directly from a copper cup as soon as you wake up and before you eat or drink anything. Check out the accompanying video for more information and keep reading.Other benefits that have been touted are that it slows aging, makes skin glow, fights and prevents cancer, stimulates our brains, regulates our thyroid, reduces the risk of heart disease and hypertension, helps or bodies absorb iron and thus helps prevent anemia. These benefits are not new age psychobabble, there is scientific evidence and studies backing them. One of the more interesting and consequential findings had to do with the anti-microbial and anti-bacterial aspects of copper in conjunction with contaminated water. Scientists measured the number of harmful microbes found in the water before it was placed in copper, then again 16 hours later, after it had been placed in copper. They found that the level of harmful microbes was greatly reduced just because of the simple fact that the water was in the copper. Another study was equally promising and found that in one hospital with copper surfaces, infection rates were reduced by 40%. The drop was attributed to the copper surfaces alone, and researchers found that it also killed 97% of the harmful bacteria which can cause infection.", "is_fake": 1},

Compared to the placebo, drinking the cherry juice resulted in an average of 84 more minutes of sleep time each night.Cherry juice is a natural source of the sleep-wake cycle hormone melatonin and amino acid tryptophan, says study coauthor Frank L.

They fluctuate between hot and cold like crazy and it makes them really difficult to read and subsequently, be with emotionally. A Scorpio can be an incredibly draining partner to be with which is why they often find themselves in and out of relationships. Frankly, until a Scorpio matures emotionally, they\u2019re simply not ready for a real relationship.There are no sign more flighty, impulsive, and all over the place than a Sagittarius. In some ways, this makes them very exciting partners and whoever they\u2019re with will never be bored. But on the flip side, it makes them nearly impossible to get to settle down.

If you\u2019re like me and millions of other people who do exactly that, you just used your chopsticks wrong. That\u2019s because there is a better, more useful way to break them apart. Instead of snapping them in half, break off the very top portion and then use that piece as a chopstick rest. Now you have a clean spot off the table to rest your chopsticks and nothing will end up getting dirty.The clever trick has been described by many as a chopstick life hack after an Australian woman, who goes by the name BortofDarkness on Twitter, posted an image of it which quickly went viral. The internet responded and for the most part people are fascinated by the information. Some even shared other related life hacks of their own.A popular tip that many people swear by involves modifying chopsticks to make them a lot easier to use. The simple trick requires just a rubber band and a thin strip of paper. In this short video DaveHax shows you how to make a pair of user-friendly chopsticks. These are great for beginners and those who always seem to struggle with chopsticks, so be sure to check it out. All you need to do is wrap a rubber band around one end of the chopsticks. Roll up a little piece of paper and slide it down in between the 2 sticks until it reaches the spot right in front of the rubber band. When you close the chopsticks it will spring back open since the rubber band and piece of paper give it resistance. This makes them similar to tongs in that they grab food, and picking things up this way is a lot easier to do than with traditionally held chopsticks.

The metabolism of cancer cells has a very narrow pH tolerance for cellular proliferation (mitosis), which is between 6.5 and 7.5. As such, if you can interfere with cancer cell metabolism by either lowering or raising the internal cancer cell pH, you can theoretically stop cancer progression.While lowering cancer cell pH (increasing acidity) is effective against cancer cell mitosis in the lab, increasing acid levels in the live body of a cancer patient puts stress on normal cells and causes a lot of pain. So the proposed alkaline therapy for people is a \u201chigh pH therapy\u201d and has been developed to normalize the intracellular pH of the cancer patient\u2019s body through elimination of latent acidosis, while increasing the pH of cancer cells to a range above 7.5. According to published research, it is at that pH they revert to a normal cellular apoptosis cycle (programed cell death).", "is_fake": 1},

Mnemonics use exactly this feature and help you store information in a specific code, allowing you to recall it in a friendly form. Sounds complicated, right? Well, it is not. When you use a mnemonic you will use a simple rhyme or abbreviation to remember information. To do that you will use already known images, data, smells and other things to link new data to the old. For example, HOMES can stand for the names of the Great Lakes and it is easy to remember, so you would find it easier to remember Huron Ontario Michigan Erie Superior in this form, rather than individual lake names. A mnemonic can be anything, not only a word, so feel free to use your imagination and work your way up to master this memory improvement technique.Memory is like a car: if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it. To improve memory and help your brain stay focused all the time, learn something new as frequently as possible. There is no recipe for a long life, but all people who lived more than the average had this one thing in common (among others, like a healthy diet): they used their mind all the time. Learn a new dance, a new language, a new game \u2013 anything appealing to you and it will help you improve your memory and acquire new skills in the process, as well as friends.

The U.S. FDA made public 92 symptoms attributed to aspartame from submitted complaints. Despite its questionable effect, aspartame was approved for use in 1981 and still continues to be so today. Ironically, aspartame was never tested in humans before its approval. Its use in over 6,000 products and by 250 million people has made the public its unwitting guinea pig in a grand experiment 40 years in the making.Stocking up on diet foods is the best way to gain weight. Latest research on aspartame has revealed that it actually increases the risk of weight gain. Being 200 times sweeter than sugar, aspartame appears to be the perfect answer to dieting since it contains only a few calories while still having the sweet taste of sugar. Unfortunately, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, major components of aspartame, trigger the release of insulin and leptins. The latter are hormones that stimulate storage of body fat.Moreover, large doses of phenylalanine lower serotonin levels and lead to food cravings. Since both real and artificial sweeteners stimulate the taste buds, they affect the same taste and pleasure pathways in the brain. Artificial sweeteners, however, merely activate but do not satiate the pleasure-related region of the brain, proving to be an inferior system in preventing sugar cravings.

For medical personnel, this is just enough time to avoid risking a heart attack or permanent brain injury when oxygen is restricted or cut off to patients.Dr. John Kheir, who first began the study, works in the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Department of Cardiology. He found inspiration for the drug in 2006, when he was treating a girl in the ICU who had a severe case of pneumonia. At the time, the girl didn\u2019t have a breathing tube, when at the time she suffered from a pulmonary hemorrhage. This means her lungs had begin to fill up with blood, and she finally went into cardiac arrest. It took doctors about 25 minutes to remove enough blood from her lungs to allow her to breath.

Apricot seeds are the best source for B17, but they have also been removed from the shelves of every health food store and natural market throughout the USA. Limited research has been conducted on vitamin B17 since 1977. Once it was banned, it was forgotten.According to research from years ago, provided by nutritionists and medical scientists, vitamin B17 is a natural cyanide-containing compound that gives up its cyanide content only in the presence of a particular enzyme group called beta glucosidase or glucuronidase. Miraculously, this enzyme group is found almost exclusively in cancer cells. If found elsewhere in the body, it is accompanied by greater quantities of another enzyme, rhodanese, which has the ability to disable the cyanide and convert it into completely harmless substances. Cancer tissues do not have this protecting enzyme.So, according to past scientific knowledge, cancer cells are faced with a double threat: the presence of one enzyme exposing them to cyanide, while the absence of another enzyme found in all other normal cells results in the cancer\u2019s failure to detoxify itself. Leave it to nature to provide a form of cyanide that can naturally destroy a cancer cell.

About 400 million years ago, there was an area of land that is now called the Michigan Basin. This area was separated from the ocean but kept sinking lower and lower into the Earth. Because it continued to sink, the salt water from the ocean poured in as the ocean receded. Once the ocean water evaporated, it left behind huge salt deposits.Throughout hundreds of thousands of years, the Niagara Escarpment was formed. This was a large basalt rock area that covered a lot of land, including the whole state of Michigan. Because of this rock, it buried the salt mine, basically preserving it 1200 feet below the Earth. According to some estimates, there is 71 TRILLION tons of unmined salt in these mines.\u00a0 Even though salt is not currently a hot commodity, it was at one time. For example, a long time ago in China, salt coins were used for payments and salt cakes were used in the Mediterranean. Even Romans paid their soldiers in salt!When the salt was discovered in Detroit in 1895, everyone was thrilled! The Detroit Salt and Manufacturing Company came in 11 years later, in 1906, and decided to start digging a shaft down to the salt. But during this process they went bankrupt due to the high cost of the project, and many workers lost their lives.\u00a0But they kept on trying. In 1910, The Detroit Salt and Manufacturing Company completed the 1,060 foot shaft and began working on the second salt bed. They were bought by Watkins Salt Company. After the shaft was completed and the second salt bed complete, they increased their productivity and purity.

Certain South American tribes used to bind infants\u2019 skulls in order to change their shape.

Legend holds that Queen Victoria of England so loved the Mangosteen that she offered varying rewards \u2014 from money to knighthood \u2014 to anyone who could bring her a Mangosteen in pristine ripeness.The Mangosteen is a very slow-growing fruit tree. Young trees do not produce fruit generally until 10 years of age. The prime harvest period for most Mangosteen trees is between 20 and 45 years old, with many trees still producing fruit after 100 years. Mangosteen trees can grow to be as tall as 75 feet, and harvesting must be done by hand, as the result of a hard fall can severely damage the fruit.Mangosteen trees need humid, tropical environments to thrive and produce fruit. Because of the specific environmental requirements, cultivation of the Mangosteen has been largely confined to plantations in its native habitats of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Expansion of Mangosteen cultivation has been attempted in Sri Lanka, South India, Central and South America, Australia, Brazil, and Florida and Hawaii in the United States, all with mixed results and only small harvests where the cultivation has been successful.", "is_fake": 1},

Sure, you could say there is to a degree, but mostly we spend a lot of time defining and judging what is to be considered as positive and what we consider to be as negative. The brain is a very powerful tool and as we define what something is or should be, we begin to have that result play out in our world. Have you ever noticed, for example that someone driving can get cut off and lose their lid, get angry and suddenly they are feeling negative, down and in \u00a0bad mood? Whereas someone else can get cut off while driving and simply apply the break slightly and move on with their day as if nothing happened. In this case, the same experience yet one sees it as negative while the other doesn\u2019t. So are things innately positive and negative? Or do we define things as positive and negative?After thinking about it for a moment you might realize that there are in fact no positive or negative experiences other than what we define as such. Therefore our very perception of an experience or situation has the ultimate power as to how we will feel when it\u2019s happening and how our bodies will be affected. While we can always work to move beyond our definitions of each experience and move into a state of mind/awareness/consciousness where we simply accept each experience for what it is and use it as a learning grounds for us, we may not be there yet and so it\u2019s important to understand how certain emotions can affect our health.", "is_fake": 1},

The bodies in the tombs had some of the largest elongated skulls ever discovered on the planet, called the Paracas skulls. The Peruvian archeologist discovered over 300 mysterious skulls which are believed to be at least around 3000 years old.As if the mysterious shape of the skulls wasn\u2019t weird enough, a recent DNA analysis performed on some of the skulls presented some of the most enigmatic and incredible results that challenge everything we know about the origin and human evolutionary tree. The cranium of the Paracas skulls is are least 25 % larger and up to 60% heavier than the skulls of regular human beings. Researchers firmly believe that these traits could not have been achieved through head bindings as some scientists suggest. Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth.

{"date": 2019, "title": "Top 6 Supplements To Boost Your Pineal Gland Function", "text": "For the people that seek to fully activate their spiritual potential and tap into the power of the pineal gland, one must begin by strengthening its function though detoxification and proper nutrition. Researchers are finding that in many people, due to our poor diet with pesticide and chemical-laden foods and environmental toxins such as fluoride in our water, the pineal gland and our entire bodies are becoming exposed to many more toxins and nano-organisms than ever before. These form calcium shells around themselves for protection from our immune systems which has resulted in calcification of the pineal gland, a build-up of calcium phosphate crystals in various parts of the human body. Many of us have a pineal gland that is already completely calcified. This does not fare well when we try to tap into the esoteric capabilities of this gland through yoga practice, meditation, using plant medicines such as ayahuasca, and so forth. The process of detoxification is an essential place to start if we want to exploit our full spiritual capabilities.Below is a list, in no particular order, of 6 supplements that will boost your pineal gland function, help in its decalcification, and support you on your journey of personal and spiritual cultivation. Some of the supplements offer similar results, so it is up to you to decide which combination of supplements will work best for you.Both oregano oil and neem extract help in the purification process, helping to remove existing calcification within the pineal gland, in addition to purifying the body\u2019s systems, especially the endocrine system. Neem has been used in this way in India for thousands of years. In the western world, oregano oil is also becoming a holistic way of fortifying the immune support system. In the longer term, both of these supplements will act as a natural antibiotic against new calcium shells created by nanobacteria.", "is_fake": 1},

I would like to share with you my testimony of what happened to me, but first I would like to give some brief background information from my life growing up. I was born in 1958 in the town of Bogale, on the Irrawaddy Delta area of southern Myanmar [formerly Burma]. My parents, who were devout Buddhists like most people in Myanmar, named me Thitpin [which means \u2018tree\u2019 in English]. Our lives were very simple where I grew up. At the age of 13 I left school and started working on a fishing boat. We caught fish and sometimes also shrimp from the numerous rivers and streams in the Irrawaddy area. At the age of 16 I became the leader of the boat. At this time I lived in Upper Mainmahlagyon Island [Mainmahlagyon means \u2018Beautiful Woman Island\u2019 in English], just north of Bogale where I was born. This place is about 100 miles southwest of Yangon [Rangoon], our nation\u2019s capital city.One day, when I was 17, we caught a large number of fish in our nets. Because of the many fish, a large crocodile was attracted to us. It followed our boat and tried to attack us. We were terrified so we frantically rowed our boats toward the riverbank as fast as we could. The crocodile followed us and smashed our boat with its tail. Although no one died in this incident, the attack greatly affected my life. I no longer wanted to fish. Our small boat sank because of the crocodile attack. We had to go home to our village that night on a passenger boat. Not long after, my father\u2019s employers transferred my father to Yangon City [formerly spelt Rangoon]. At the age of 18 I was sent to a Buddhist monastery to be a novice monk. Most parents in Myanmar try to send their son into a Buddhist monastery, at least for a time, as it is considered a great honor to have a son serve in this way. We have been observing this custom for many hundreds of years.\nWhen I turned 19 years and 3 months old (in 1977), I became a normal monk. The senior monk at my monastery gave me a new Buddhist name, which is the custom in our country. I was now called U Nata Pannita Ashinthuriya. When we become a monk we no longer use the name given to us at birth by our parents. The name of the monastery I lived at is called Mandalay Kyaikasan Kyaing. The senior monk\u2019s name was called U Zadila Kyar Ni Kan Sayadaw [U Zadila is his title]. He was the most famous Buddhist monk in all of Myanmar at the time. Everyone knew who he was. He was widely honored by the people and respected as a great teacher. I say he \u201cwas\u201d because in 1983 he suddenly died when he was involved in a fatal car accident.

Tablets that date back 20,000 years have taken an archaeologist more than 20 years to translate and when he did they changed his whole life. Zecharia Sitchin began to translate the tablets 50 years ago at a time when there weren\u2019t any other Sumerian translators to help him. The tablets were complex and this proved to be a huge challenge. They had been written in a longer period of time and so they followed the many changes to the Sumerian language.Following hard work for more than 20 years, Zecharia managed to translate what he says is an autobiography of an alien from a planet with the name of Nibiru. The name of the alien was Enki and the story in the tablets began a long time before humans came to be. The story in the tablets begins with the account of Enki of arrival on Earth with 20 more astronauts and wife, as they searched for a material that allowed for life to perpetuate on their home planet, gold. The tablets revealed that the atmosphere of the planet had to have gold dust so that it could reflect ultraviolet radiation and this was making life very difficult on Nibiru.The alien went on to say that while they were trying to excavate the gold from Earth, the Sumerian gods were not able to endure the physical work. Enki then came up with the idea of servants by combining DNA with the hominids on Earth. Then came the mission to create sentient humans was given to Enki\u2019s wife, a doctor and a scientist. There have been many theories about the creation of humans through intervention, along with evolutionary path, already proven.

But in the samples that were analyzed, which came from the Oklo deposit in Gabon, a former French colony in West Africa, the uranium 235 constituted only 0.717 percent. That small difference was enough to alert French scientists that there was something very strange going on with the minerals. These small details led to further investigations which showed that at least a part of the mine was well below the normal amount of uranium 235: some 200 kilograms appeared to have been extracted in the distant past, today, that amount is enough to make half a dozen nuclear bombs. Soon, researchers and scientists from all over the world gathered in Gabon to explore what was going on with the Uranium from Oklo.What was fund in Oklo surprised everyone gathered there, the site where the uranium originated from is actually an advanced subterranean nuclear reactor that goes well beyond the capabilities of our present scientific knowledge. Researchers believe that this ancient nuclear reactor is around 1.8 billion years old and operated for at least 500,000 years in the distant past. Scientists performed several other investigation at the uranium mine and the results were made public at a conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to News agencies from Africa, researchers had found traces of fission products and fuel wastes at various locations within the mine.Incredibly, compared with this huge nuclear reactor, our modern-day nuclear reactors are really not comparable both in design and functionality. According to studies, this ancient nuclear reactor was several kilometers long. Interestingly, for a large nuclear reactor like this, thermal impact towards the environment was limited to just 40 meters on the\u00a0sides.

Here are some signals that your body send you every day that you need to be paying attention to.\nThe first bladder void of the day can tell you more about you overall health than you would think. Paying attention to the color of your urine is the most important thing to note. A lighter, straw-colored urine indicates that you are well hydrated and healthy. Darker urine can indicate that you need more water of possibly have an infection. Also, the amount of urine you produce is important. When you are dehydrated your body doesn\u2019t produce urine because it is holding as much water as possible. Changes in the smell, color or density of urine is often the first sign of health problems because urine is the by-product of your body removing toxins.\nOur mouths are the major gateway into our bodies, and therefore the first indication of health problems. For instance, if you notice that your gum bleed when you brush your teeth, there is a good chance that you have some form of gum disease. Gum disease can lead to other infections throughout the body, and are linked to several different medical conditions. Your teeth themselves can give signs of infection or disease as well.

Amorth also teaches bishops how to tell the difference between satanic possession and psychiatric illness, noting that those who suffer from the former seem to be particularly repulsed by the sight of holy water and the cross.With 1.5 crimes per citizen, Vatican City has the highest crime rate in the world.\nIt\u2019s not that the cardinals are donning masks and repeatedly robbing the bank, it\u2019s just that the massive crowds of tourists make Vatican City a pickpocket\u2019s paradise. The situation is complicated by the fact that the Vatican has no working prison and only one judge. So most criminals are simply marched across the border into Italy, as part of a pact between the two countries. (The Vatican\u2019s legal code is based on Italy\u2019s, with some modifications regarding abortion and divorce.) Crimes that the Vatican sees fit to try itself \u2014 mainly shoplifting in its duty-free stores \u2014 are usually punished by temporarily revoking the troublemaker\u2019s access to those areas. But not every crime involves theft. In 2007, the Vatican issued its first drug conviction after an employee was found with a few ounces of cocaine in his desk.", "is_fake": 1},

This results in DNA that is faulty or damaged, and this in turn can lead to problems like cancer that greatly shorten life expectancy.However, the strong antioxidant properties of blueberries can help avoid this process and reduce the risk of DNA damage and flaws and thus improve the chances of avoiding many chronic diseases that can shorten life.Because of their high antioxidant content, extracts of blueberries have shown the ability to help repair DNA damage and to reduce the oxidative stress to the cells that can bring about the damage to begin with.

How was it used? And why was it abandoned? These are the questions that have continued to both fascinate and frustrate experts ever since its discovery.The Construction of Por Bajin Believed to have been constructed in 757 AD, the ancient complex has outer walls that still rise to 40 feet (12 meters) in height and inner walls of 3-5 feet (1 \u2013 1.5 meters), some still covered with lime plaster painted with horizontal red stripes. A main gate was discovered, opening into two successive courtyards connected by another gate. The walls enclose an area of about seven acres containing the remains of more than 30 buildings, but with a two-part central structure linked by a covered walkway, which once had a tiled roof and was supported by 36 wooden columns resting on stone bases.

Founded on May 1, 1776, the organization created by Adam Weishaupt blurred the line between \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d Secret Societies. By\u00a0 mixing the occult sciences of Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism while conspiring to achieve precise political goals, the Illuminati became an actor on the world stage. While most Secret Societies of the time catered to rich people and their fascination with occultism, the Bavarian Illuminati actively sought to profoundly change the world.Secret Societies have existed throughout the course of history, each of them with different aims and with different roles in society. While the Egyptian mystery schools were part of the Egyptian institution, other groups were secret due to their subversive and conspiratorial aims.

The public has been told that it was constructed at a cost of tens of billions of Euros for the purpose of studying the birth of the universe and the collisions that take place within the collider allow us a quick glimpse at certain phenomenon that can only be witnessed when particles hit one another at incredibly high rates. This is NOT what the machine was designed for, nor is it what the machine has been used for since it\u2019s inception. CERN\u2019s main purpose for building the Collider was too, well it was to open a door way. Allow me to explain: the doorway idea came into fruition in the 1960s.After years and years of attempting to hide UFO phenomenon, including large scale and very public interactions such as the Roswell incident, and the Battle for Los Angeles incident well before that, the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France decided to throw their weight behind the understanding of what precisely these objects were. The ideas flew far and wide. Were UFOs from another planet? Were they from another time? Or where they simply mass hysteria and mass delusion fueled by the overactive imagination of a public who were shit scared of communists and their technology? No, they were none of those. Our universe is but one page in a large book. Think of a closed book sitting on a table: you see each page stacked on top of one another, bound by the spine and sandwiched between the two covers. Our universe is but one page in a vast and all-encompassing book. And our page is certainly not the only one with rich, in depth thought and writing committed to it. Every page in the book represents a different dimension each with it\u2019s own unique writing, own unique story, own unique way of isolating itself from the other pages. No page was to interact with the other, just as no ink bleeds from one page to another in a standard book. Each page, a universe unto itself.Within a few short years of mathematical research and fleets of scientists working under threat of extermination should they share their research, the book idea was finally cemented. Though many disagreed, the mathematics were there to support the book idea, and the mathematics also showed us that it was impossible for one page to interact with another. That was, until the 1980s. During the 1980s billions of dollars of research was funnelled into the idea that if we used enough energy, if we used enough force, concentrated into a small area (the size of a pin prick) we could theoretically tare our page and get a glimpse of the page next to ours. We could open a door from their universe to ours. When the Family (the code name for the group of scientists that functioned as the head of each of their departments at CERN) were shown the initial presentation in March of 1981, many of them expressed grave concern about the ramifications of opening such a doorway. But in the beautiful name of science, the Family decided to share these ideas with the governments who constantly funded their research. At a meeting held in Luxembourg, the heads of state of the newly forming European Union, along with the United States and China were shown plans for the construction of a colossal machine that would enable the opening of a doorway that could be closed at our discretion. The door would be opened, and the energy levels would be measure to prove that CERN had accomplished its task, and the door would be closed. Open. Shut. Simple as that.", "is_fake": 1},

DC could not (it required a large power plant every square mile and had to be transmitted through very thick cables). Tesla also invented electric motors that today are used in every appliance in your house. He invented fluorescent bulbs and neon signs. He designed the world\u2019s first hydroelectric plant, in Niagara Falls and patented the first speedometer for cars. Thomas Edison, who\u2019s money was invested in DC power systems, did his best to discredit Tesla. Edison even went so far as to claimed that AC electricity was far more dangerous than his DC power.At the 1893 World Exposition in Chicago, Tesla demonstrated the safety AC electricity was by passing high frequency AC power through his body to power light bulbs. He then was able to shoot large lightning bolts from his Tesla coils to the crowd without harm.By 1898, he was demonstrating to the world the first remote controlled model boat at Madison Square Garden. Tesla wanted to provide free energy to the world and in 1900 began construction of a \u201cWireless Broadcasting System\u201d tower on Long Island, New York. This tower was intended to link the world\u2019s telephone and telegraph services, and transmit pictures, stock reports, and weather information worldwide. \u00a0 Tesla ran into financial trouble with the world thinking he was insane. The transmission of voice, picture, and electricity was unheard of at this time. Tesla demonstrated the principles behind radio nearly ten years before Marconi. In 1943 the US Supreme Court ruled that Marconi\u2019s patents were invalid due to Tesla\u2019s descriptions of his work. Still, most references do not credit Tesla with the invention of radio. \u00a0 Tesla made the earth into an electric tuning fork by getting a steam-driven oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the ground. The result was an earthquake in the surrounding city. He had accurately determined the resonant frequencies of the Earth almost 60 years before science could confirm his results. \u00a0 In 1899, he sent waves of energy through the Earth, thus providing the theory for earthquake seismic stations. By adding electricity to the returning energy he created the largest man-made lightning bolt ever recorded (130 feet). The accompanying thunder was heard 22 miles away and created a blue glow around the meadow outside his Colorado laboratory. \u00a0 At the beginning of World War I, Tesla proposed the use of energy waves to detect German submarines (known today as RADAR).

For over a millennium, scholars have fiercely debated the events that lead to his death. His body was treated with a complex array of different treatments following his death that preserved his mortal remains.\u00a0Many questions were answered after his tomb was unearthed. CT scans discovered a deep cut on his throat, 7 centimeters (2.7 in) in length and going almost to his spine. This cut would have severed not only his major blood vessels, but his esophagus and trachea as well, ending the reign of one of the last great pharaohs of Egypt. To add insult to injury, many believe that he was murdered by his sons.In the mid-20th century, several incredibly well-preserved bodies were discovered in a peat bog in Denmark. Among them, the Grauballe Man is the most fascinating. His still-haunted face, stark red hair, and perfectly discernible facial features also make him one of the most unsettling mummies to look at.\u00a0Radiocarbon dating of his still-intact liver showed that he lived more than 2,000 years ago, and the evidence found with his body\u2014or lack thereof\u2014suggests that he was killed as part of a sacrificial ritual. He died when he was about 30 years old, probably from a deep cut to the neck.If you need another reminder that tattoos are forever, the Ukok Princess proves the point. While her body itself isn\u2019t particularly well-preserved, she is notable for the intricate tattoos\u00a0that still paint her mummified skin, despite the fact that she died more than 2,500 years ago.

These nomads held a deep-seated belief that tattoos helped people to find one another in the afterlife.\u00a0Because of this, their tattoos were some of the most elaborate in the world at that time.

Republished in 1975 by Keats Publishing Inc., 27 Pine Street, New Canaan Conn. 06840, USA.To Noble Tiberius Caesar, Emperor of Rome. Noble Sovereign, Greeting: The events of the last few days in my province have been of such a character that I will give the details in full as they occurred, as I should not be surprised if, in the course of time, they may change the destiny of our nation, for it seems of late that all the gods have ceased to be propitious. I am almost ready to say, Cursed be the day that I succeeded Vallerius Flaceus in the government of Judea; for since then my life has been one of continual uneasiness and distress. On my arrival at Jerusalem I took possession of the praetorium, and ordered a splendid feast to be prepared, to which I invited the tetrarch of Galilee, with the high priest and his officers. At the appointed hour no guests appeared. This I considered an insult offered to my dignity, and to the whole government which I represent. A few days after, the high priest deigned to pay me a visit. His deportment was grave and deceitful.He pretended that his religion forbade him and his attendants to sit at the table with the Romans, and eat and offer libations with them, but this was only a sanctimonious seeming, for his very countenance betrayed his hypocrisy. Although I thought it expedient to accept his excuse, from that moment I was convinced that the conquered had declared themselves the enemy of the conquerors; and I would warn the Romans to beware of the high priests of this country. They would betray their own mother to gain office and a luxurious living. It seems to me that, of conquered cities, Jerusalem is the most difficult to govern. So turbulent are the people that I live in momentary dread of an insurrection. I have not soldiers sufficient to suppress it. I had only one centurion and a hundred men at my command. I requested a reinforcement from the prefect of Syria, who informed me that he had scarcely enough troops sufficient to defend his own province. An insatiate thirst for conquest to extend our empire beyond the means of defending it, I fear, will be the cause of the final overthrow of our whole government. I lived secluded from the masses, for I did not know what those priests might influence the rabble to do; yet I endeavored to ascertain, as far as I could, the mind and standing of the people.", "is_fake": 1},

Costco\u2019s decision to stop purchasing animals who have been dosed with human-use antibiotics will have a positive long term effect on the effectiveness of antibiotics and make immune systems stronger.The best immunity you can have is a natural immunity. Fortifying your immune system through diet and exercise can keep you from getting sick, but our overuse of antibiotics is not helping. It\u2019s like giving the bacteria a ten second head start in a race to see which organism wins. If you\u2019re exposed to a low level strain of bacteria and beat the infection, it gives your immune system more protection against stronger version of that particular infection. Low level dosages of antibiotics kill the weak bacteria, combining with the sickening conditions of factory farming to create ideal condition for antibiotic resistant, transmittable to humans infections like E Coli, Salmonella, and Staph. Feeding antibiotics to factory farmed animals is not only unnecessary and unhealthy, it\u2019s dangerous. The groups receiving long-term benefits from this practice are big agricultural companies and big pharmaceutical companies. When major retailers like Costco and McDonalds choose to stop purchasing those products, the lack of that business sends a powerful message.People care about what\u2019s in their food. From labeling GMOs to buying organic to finding local farmers they can trust, consumers are using their dollars to advocate for food transparency.

On one side we have medical evidence that suggests we should avoid using it and on the other side we lean on the FDA\u2019s approval that suggests it is safe. Since generally that seems to be the factor that many continue to hold trust based upon, I thought we could look into the Aspartame story to find out how it came to be accepted as safe by the FDA. You would think that something so widely used and so well accepted would have quite the pristine story leading to its acceptance. I imagine one will discover otherwise after reading this post.It all starts in the mid 1960\u2032s with a company called G.D. Searle. One of their chemists accidentally creates aspartame while trying to create a cure for\u00a0stomach\u00a0ulcers. Searle decides to put aspartame through a testing process which eventually leads to its approval by the FDA. Not long after, serious health affects begin to arise and G.D. Searle comes under fire for their testing practices. It is revealed that the testing process of Aspartame was among the worst the investigators had ever seen and that in fact the product was unsafe for use.\u00a0Aspartame triggers the first criminal investigation of a\u00a0manufacturer put into place by the FDA in 1977. By 1980 the FDA bans aspartame from use after having 3\u00a0independent\u00a0scientists\u00a0study\u00a0the sweetener.

{"date": 2019, "title": "Did Ancient People Really Have Lifespans Longer Than 200 Years?", "text": "It isn\u2019t only biblical figures who lived to well-seasoned ages of 900 years or more. Ancient texts from many cultures have listed life spans most modern people find simply and literally unbelievable. Some say it\u2019s due to misunderstandings in the translation process, or that the numbers have symbolic meaning\u2014but against the many explanations are also counterarguments that leave the historian wondering whether the human lifespan has actually decreased so significantly over thousands of years. For example, one explanation is that the ancient Near East understanding of a year could be different than our concept of a year today. Perhaps a year meant an orbit of the moon (a month) instead of an orbit of the sun (12 months). But if we make the changes accordingly, while it brings the age of the biblical figure Adam down from 930 to a more reasonable 77 at the time of his death, it also means he would have fathered his son Enoch at the age of 11. And Enoch would have only been 5 years old when he fathered Methuselah. Similar inconsistencies arise when we adjust the year figures to represent seasons instead of solar orbits, noted Carol A. Hill in her article \u201cMaking Sense of the Numbers of Genesis,\u201d published in the journal \u201cPerspectives on Science and Christian Faith\u201d in December 2003. Similar problems have arisen when adjusting ages in ancient texts with the assumption that authors used a certain pattern for skewing the actual ages (such as multiplying them by a given number). \u201cNumbers [in Genesis] could have both real (numerical) and sacred (numerological or symbolic) meaning,\u201d Hill wrote.In both Genesis and in the 4,000-year-old Sumerian King List\u2014which lists the reigns of single kings in Sumer (ancient southern Iraq) as exceeding 30,000 years in some cases\u2014analysts have noted the use of square numbers. Much like the Bible, the King List shows a steady decline in lifespans. The list differentiates between pre-flood and post-flood reigns. The pre-flood reigns are significantly longer than the post-flood, though even post-flood lifespans are shown to be several hundred years or more than 1,000 years. In the Bible, we see a progressive decline over the generations from Adam\u2019s 930-year life, to Noah\u2019s 500 years, to Abraham\u2019s 175. Dwight Young of Brandeis University wrote of the post-flood lifespans in the Sumerian King List: \u201cIt is not merely because of their largeness that some of these numbers appear artificial. Etana\u2019s 1560 years, to cite the longest, is but the sum of the two preceding reigns. \u2026 Certain spans seem simply to have arisen as multiples of 60. Other large numbers may be recognized as squares: 900, the square of 30; 625, the square of 25; 400, the square of 20 \u2026 even among smaller figures, the square of six appears more frequently than one might expect.\u201d Young\u2019s article, titled \u201cA Mathematical Approach to Certain Dynastic Spans in the Sumerian King List,\u201d was published in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies in 1988. Paul Y. Hoskisson, director of the Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies wrote along a similar vein of the patriarch ages in the Bible in a short article for the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship. On the other hand, looking at patterns, co-founder of the Church of God in South Texas Arthur Mendez thinks the rate of decline in longevity from pre-flood times as recorded in ancient texts to today matches the rate of decay observed in organisms when they are exposed to radiation or toxins.In ancient China, super-centenarians were also commonplace, according to many texts. Joseph P. Hou, Ph.D., acupuncturist, wrote in his book \u201cHealthy Longevity Techniques\u201d: \u201cAccording to Chinese medical records, a doctor named Cuie Wenze of the Qin dynasty lived to be 300 years old. Gee Yule of the later Han dynasty lived to be 280 years old. A high ranking Taoist master monk, Hui Zhao, lived to be 290 years old and Lo Zichange lived to be 180 years old. As recorded in the The Chinese Encyclopedia of Materia Medica, He Nengci of the Tang dynasty lived to be 168 years old. A Taoist master, Li Qingyuan, lived to be 250 years old. In modern times, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, Lo Mingshan of Sichuan province, lived to be 124 years old.\u201d Dr. Hou said the Eastern key to longevity is \u201cnourishing life,\u201d including not only physical nourishment, but also mental and spiritual nourishment.

They had a blast jumping around, going down the slide, wrestling, and doing all the rough and tumble stuff that boys love to do. Fast forward 2 days, which is when Brenda noticed odd looking marks on her 10 year old son\u2019s arm. She asked him what it was and he said he thought it was from the bouncy castle and assumed the plastic had somehow burned his skin. When Brenda noticed the sores had spread to his tummy she immediately took him to the hospital.At first doctors had no idea what it was, but when Brenda mentioned he had been in a bounce castle, a light went off. At that point the doctor knew it was a staph infection. The sores were likely caused by bacteria that had stuck to the plastic of the inflatable castle, similar to the way bacteria commonly sticks to wrestling mats. The two things are breeding grounds for bacteria since they are rarely washed and cleaned properly. Combine that with lots of people using them, stepping all over the place and tracking in dirt, germs, bacteria, and so on, and you have the perfect environment for contracting a staph infection.The news program featured in the video spoke with a public safety official who told them state regulations require owners to maintain bounce castles in accordance with manufacturer requirements. These vary as to care and maintenance instructions, and generally advise vacuuming and wiping it down with a mild cleaner after each use. However, realistically it\u2019s impossible to know if the bouncy house your child is about to play in has been cleaned at all, or ever.

Pour the sea salt into the sock before tying it up and closing it off with a knot. It\u2019s vital that you use these exact two \u201cingredients\u201d since no alternative versions of them will be nearly as effective. If you fail to use a plain cotton sock that is completely all white, and instead go with one that has even just a colored line on it, you\u2019ll likely end up melting or even burning it. There is something in the coloring which makes them highly flammable, so be aware and use caution. The sea salt also matters because of the larger sized, more coarse granules it comes in and its ability to retain heat. Regular old table salt won\u2019t work and will just seep out of the sock, so don\u2019t substitute it in place of the sea salt!The next step is to warm up a skillet over medium-low heat before placing the salt sock in the pan.

You\u2019ll know the sock is done when it\u2019s very warm to the touch, but not so hot that it might burn you. Finally, all you have left to do is place the heated sock over your aching ear, making sure that it also rests on the area behind your jaw.

It\u2019s that simple!This is one of the best ways to naturally and effectively decrease any discomfort or inflammation in the ear that\u2019s causing you pain.

Everything from the engines to the rivets have to be tested and inspected for performance. One design aspect that many people notice, yet tend to overlook, are plane windows. If you look closely, you can see a tiny hole near the bottom of the pane. Ever wonder why it\u2019s there? I have. Turns out this little hole has a name, it\u2019s called a breather hole, or a bleeder hole, and it\u2019s located on the middle layer of the window. All airplane windows consist of 3 layers. The part that you can touch when you\u2019re inside the cabin is called the scratch cover and it\u2019s there to protect the real window from being damaged, poked, or destroyed. The middle piece is called the inner pane, which has the hole in it, and then there is the outer pane. These two panes are both half-inch thick pieces of Plexiglas which are separated by a half an inch of air. The hole allows warm air in-between the inner and outer panes and releases moisture from the air gap, which keeps the window mostly fog and frost free.The other, more important, function of the hole is to contain and regulate the pressure exerted on the windows. Planes are pressurized during a flight so that people can breathe safely, and the pressure inside the cabin is much greater than the outside air pressure.The outer two cabin panes are designed to contain this difference in pressure and each is strong enough to withstand it on their own. However, the bleeder hole makes it so that the outer pane bears the pressure. This is because the hole allows the pressure to become balanced between the interior cabin and the air gap between the panes, thus placing the cabin pressure on the outside pane. If the outer pane were to ever fail, the middle one would then take over, instead of the entire window imploding or exploding (which would depend on whatever the pressure differential is). Turns out that the tiny bleeder hole serves a major purpose.", "is_fake": 1},

In this case, a focus on healing foods and herbs that have strong antibacterial and antiviral properties is of primary importance, along with improving immune system function and eliminating foods that suppress it.Even though Ebola is a virus, it only makes sense to start clearing out any harmful bacteria in your digestive system in order for your immune system to function properly.

One such place lies high in the cold remoteness of the Himalayan mountains. In this place of desolate, bitter cold, unforgiving biting winds, and jagged peaks looms a virtually unexplored mountain steeped in myth and magic known as\u00a0Gangkhar Puensum, located in Bhutan near the border with China. It may seem surprising that despite the fact that humankind had already summited the 20 highest peaks in the world by 1975,\u00a0Gangkhar Puensum remains even in modern times untouched, unmounted, and indeed at an elevation of\u00a07,570 meters (24,836\u00a0ft) the highest unclimbed mountain in the world.Gangkhar Puensum has always been somewhat of an enigma, and has presented numerous challenges to those who would climb it. When the elevation of the mountain was first measured in 1922, the maps of the region were shockingly inaccurate. For years, different maps would show the mountain as varying heights and even place it in entirely different locations. It was hard for people to even locate Gankhar Puensum let alone climb it, and some of the first expeditions to the mountain were unable to even find it at all. In addition, there are disputes even to this day over which country the mountain lies in, with Bhutan claiming the entirety of it and China claiming a border that cuts through its northern half.Until 1983, mountaineering was not even permitted in Bhutan since the country sought to preserve the pristine condition and spiritual importance of its sacred peaks. Local mythology gives further reason for the traditional closure of the mountains, as they were said to be the haunts of various spirits of myth and legend. When Bhutan finally opened its doors to mountaineering as a commercial pursuit for the purpose of tourism, many mountain climbers immediately set their sights on\u00a0Gangkhar Puensum, the country\u2019s highest mountain and therefore the one with the most prestige waiting for those who could fight their way to the top.", "is_fake": 1},

There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with certainty that they are harmless. Geneticist David Suzuki recently expressed his concern, saying that human beings are part of a \u201cmassive genetic experiment\u201d over many years, as thousands of people continue to consume GMO\u2019s, and it makes sense.Advances in genome science over the past few years have revealed that organisms can share their genes.

Geneticists usually followed the inheritance of genes in what they would call a \u2018vertical\u2019 fashion, such as breeding a male and female -you follow their offspring and continue down the road from there. Today, scientists recognize that genes are shared not only among the individual members of a species, but also among members of different species.\u201cOur bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system.

Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system.

The altar believed to be associated with the temple, known today as the Great Altar of Pergamon, was moved to Berlin in the 19th century by German archaeologists, who evidently had an easy time getting permission for its removal from the indifferent authorities of the Ottoman empire.Walking north from the Temple of Zeus and site of the Great Altar of Pergamon, one encounters the remains of the Temple of Athena, constructed at the end of the fourth century or beginning of the third century B.C., and dedicated to the city\u2019s patron goddess. Just beyond that to the northwest is the magnificent structure that was the city\u2019s famous library. While the estimated 200,000 documents of both papyrus and parchment may be rather high (Seneca estimates that approximately 40,000 volumes were catalogued in the larger library of Alexandria), it was certainly one of the largest collections of written material in the ancient world and was famous throughout the Mediterranean. It also housed one of the most extravagant wedding gifts of all time: Marc Antony is said to have presented Cleopatra with a sizable portion of the Pergamon library\u2019s collection, in part to restore Alexandria\u2019s own collection that went up in flames during Julius Caesar\u2019s occupation of the city.", "is_fake": 1},

They have worked hard to shut down public discussion on the topic, for several decades, with great success.They say, for example, that the problem is modest, and that critics have cherry-picked the evidence: but this is a lie. The best evidence comes from the most current review of all the literature, published in 2010. It estimates that half of all completed trials are left published, and that trials with negative results are about twice as likely to be buried.Then they pretend that the problem is in the past, and that everything has been fixed. But in reality, none of these supposed fixes were subjected to any kind of routine public audit, and all have now been well-documented as failures. What\u2019s more, they all shared one simple loophole: they only demanded information about new trials, and this is hopeless. Anything that only gets us the results of studies completing after 2008 does nothing to fix medicine today, because more than 80% of all treatments prescribed this year came to the market more than ten years ago. We need the results of clinical trials from 2007, 2003, 1999, and 1993, to make informed decisions about the medicines we use today.

Usually, when we are trying to decide what to do, whether or not to do something, we let our minds wonder and explore all the possible outcomes of the potential choices. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but often the decision making process can keep on going for an excessive amount of time. Not only does this prevent us from taking action, but it also is a sure way to waste our precious time. So, next time when you catch yourself struggling with making a decision, give yourself a time-limit. For example, when it comes to a small decision, give it 1 minute to decide and when it comes to a big one- till the end of the day. This strategy is definitely worth trying because it\u2019s simple and saves you some time and headaches.Giving yourself a break when you feel like you are not thinking straight helps a lot. We all have our moments of uncertainty and instability. In such times forcing yourself to think of a solution to a problem or making a decision can be really overwhelming. Taking a break from the negative thoughts by going for a walk or taking a nap can improve your thinking process significantly. You will feel refreshed and will be able to resolve the issue you were struggling with easier and more sufficiently.Too many people nowadays are struggling with procrastination. Maybe this is because in the age we live in there are so many potential distractions that our minds get easily attracted to and fall into the trap of constantly delaying the work that should be done. But procrastinating can also serve you as an excuse to overthink different scenarios and situations and that can drain your energy really fast. This issue is not an easy one to resolve because it requires a strong mindset and tons of determination. But if you manage to actually become a person of action and fight the unresouceful habit of procrastination, you will not only have rarer occasions to overthink but it will also improve your life in many other aspects.

One study published in the journal  showed that a man with a greater body mass index (BMI) often has a lower sperm count and poor semen quality compared to a man with a lower BMI. Lead researcher Dr. Michael Eisenberg and his colleagues found that men who were overweight and obese ejaculated an average of 2.8 milliliters (ml) of semen compared to 3.3ml among normal weight men. The healthy volume for ejaculation is between 2 and 5 milliliters. As to what causes a lower sperm count among bigger men, the research team settled on a few theories, including the notion that greater fat storage can result in testosterone turning into the female hormone estrogen. It could also be due to a hormone produced by fat cells known as leptin, which can actually damage sperm cells.", "is_fake": 1},

Take a piece of wood and secure it to a tire. In the accompanying video they used a tow strap to secure the board to the tire but any other similar type of cord, rope, or strap will do so long as you are able to tie it tightly. When you go to move the car, slowly inch forwards or backwards until the tire grips the board, and then resume a steady, slow pace.When a car gets stuck it is because the wheels have no traction. Thus, when you press on the gas the tires just spin around without going anywhere and dig the car deeper into a rut. Snow, ice, and mud all reduce the amount of traction on car tires and when the traction is super low the car won\u2019t go anywhere. The best thing you can do when you notice your car is stuck is to stop pushing your foot on the accelerator because rapidly spinning wheels reduce traction even further and will cause your car to slide.Instead, try moving the tires as slowly as possible, press gently on the gas and see if that helps. You can also dig out the area around the wheels. If your car is front wheel drive dig out the front tires because they are the ones that move when you press the gas. Cover the ground in front of each tire with stuff that can provide traction, such as gravel, stones, dirt, branches, a car mat, boards, or kitty litter. It\u2019s best to wedge certain objects, like the car mat and board, under the tire a little so that the tire can better grip it when you start to slowly drive.", "is_fake": 1},

No matter who said it, the statement makes a very good point about a cause of depression that no one seems to pay attention to: being too nice. Now before the conclusion jumpers coil their springs for lift-off, let me clarify: I\u2019m not saying that being nice to people causes depression. I\u2019m saying that when we are TOO nice to people it can certainly have a negative effect on us, and here is why:As a nice person, typically we expect the same kindness that we give to others to be returned. Unfortunately, that is so rarely the case that it\u2019s hard not to just completely lose faith in humanity. There are people out there that make a life of feeding off of the kindness of others. There are people in our own lives that keep us around simply because they know that they can depend on our kindness when they need it. It truly is disappointing. It\u2019s disappointing that people use us like that. When we find ourselves disappointed in people, it is easy to place the blame on ourselves. We harbor the regret, knowing that even though we say \u201cnever again\u201d, the next chance we get to help \u2013 we will.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re totally okay with being nice to everyone all the time, no matter if they return the gesture or not. As great as that is, you have to keep in mind: Kindness is usually perceived as weakness. I know, that perception is far from the truth. Just because you poke a lion with a stick and it doesn\u2019t bite your head off, doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t capable of it. It just means he is choosing not to, and because of that, people will poke away. The same goes for people who are too nice. Once others figure out that they can push your buttons and test your boundaries and you don\u2019t put them in their place and stand up for yourself, it\u2019s going to happen on a regular basis. People will poke away with reckless abandon. If you think bullying ended in elementary school, you\u2019re wrong. The bullies just grew up and changed tactics. Not all of the poking is meant with true malice, but eventually, those jokes and jabs add up. Even the people with the thickest skin can have brief lapses in self-worth.", "is_fake": 1},

Similarly, documentation about aloe vera was found on clay boards from Nippur which date back to 2,200 BCE.

During this period, the Neo-Assyrian Empire underwent its greatest territorial expansion, and the areas under Ashurbanipal\u2019s rule included Babylon, Persia, Syria and Egypt. As Ashurbanipal ruled over his subjects with justice and fairness, he was a popular king. Nevertheless, he is also known for his ruthlessness and cruelty when dealing with his enemies. Ashurbanipal\u2019s greatest accomplishment, however, was the creation of his royal library.Ashurbanipal had initially not been expected to succeed his father, Esarhaddon, as king, since he had an older brother, Sin-iddina-apla. When this brother died in 672 BC, Ashurbanipal was made his father\u2019s heir. Since Ashurbanipal was not originally intended to inherit the kingship prior to his elder brother\u2019s death, he was free to indulge in scholarly pursuits. As a result of this, he was able to read and write, and mastered various fields of knowledge, including mathematics and oil divination. It is perhaps due to this that Ashurbanipal had his royal library built after he had stabilized his empire.According to Old Persian and Armenian traditions, Alexander the Great himself saw the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal when he visited Nineveh. Inspired by it, he desired to seek out all the works of the peoples he had conquered, translate them into Greek, and store them in a great library of his own. Whilst the Macedonian conqueror did not live long enough to fulfil this dream of his, Ptolemy, who was one of Alexander\u2019s generals, and who succeeded him in Egypt, began the creation of the Great Library of Alexandria.", "is_fake": 1},
