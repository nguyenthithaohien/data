In addition to our AFPAC event, the best moments of this weekend came when AFPAC attendees crashed the ConInc parties at CPAC and Bill Kristol NeverTrumper confab. It was the Groypers, for example \u2014 not TPUSA or YAF youngsters \u2014 who . Holt was granted media credentials by CPAC organizers for the second year in a row, while conservative journalists were denied or booted from the conference.Here is the full video and transcript of my AFPAC remarks, which will undoubtedly be twisted and lied about by all the usual hysterical suspects collaborating on the establishment Left and Right to un-person and de-platform me, as they have done to so many others. They are losing. Below my transcript are video links to the other speakers\u2019 speeches. This movement is viral and all the walls and barriers that ConInc and their friends in high places erect can\u2019t stop it from spreading.", "is_fake": 1},
