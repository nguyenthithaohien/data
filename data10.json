The painful reality of more and more cancer cases is somehow connected to the failures of oncology. \u201cWe have to prove that modern oncology is unable to answer all the questions cancer patients have. It\u2019s our moral and ethical commitment to find the real cure for the hardest and deadliest diseases of our time,\u201d says Dr. Simonchini.\u201cAbout a century ago, there was a great theory that cancer is caused by malfunctioning genes, which means that the disease is intracellular. However, in my opinion, cancer is a fungal infection and a special cellular phenomenon,\u201d says Dr. Simonchini, who has sent shockwaves around the medical community with his claim.In the plant world, carcinoma is caused by fungal infections, and the same happens in humans. Fungi always carry a tumor with them \u2013 this has been proven in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However, scientists\u00a0believe that they develop after the disease appeared. Dr. Simonchini believes that they were already there before \u2013 fungi create cancer, weaken our immune system and then attack the whole body. Every type of cancer is caused by the Candida fungus, which has been confirmed by several studies, and its histological structure is a result of the defensive measures against the invasion. Over time, our tissues are weakened and tired, and they start producing unidentified cells. According to Dr. Simonchini, cancer is an \u201culcer\u201d where deformed cells accumulate and form colonies.", "is_fake": 1},

Dandelion leaves can be harvested at any point in the growing season, and while the smaller leaves are considered to be less bitter and more palatable raw, the bigger leaves can be eaten as well, especially as an addition to a green salad. If raw dandelion leaves don\u2019t appeal to you, they can also be steamed or added to a stir-fry or soup, which can make them taste less bitter. The flowers are sweet and crunchy, and can be eaten raw, or breaded and fried, or even used to make dandelion wine. The root of the dandelion can be dried and roasted and used as a coffee substitute, or added to any recipe that calls for root vegetables.\nThis common lawn weed (not to be confused with the tropical fruit also called plantain) is not only a great medicinal plant that can be used topically to soothe burns, stings, rashes, and wounds, but is also a great edible green for the table. The young leaves of plantain can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, or sauteed, and while the older leaves can be a bit tough, they can also be cooked and eaten as well. The seeds of the plantain, which are produced on a distinctive flower spike, can be cooked like a grain or ground into a flour, and are related to the more well-known psyllium seeds, which are sold as a fiber supplement and natural laxative.\nYou\u2019ll definitely know if you accidentally brush against this plant in the wild with your bare skin, as the leaves are covered in thousands of tiny stinging hairs. But don\u2019t let that scare you away. Stinging Nettle, which thrives along shady trails and riversides, has edible leaves, stems and roots, and contains more protein than beans and 29 times more calcium than spinach.

When a person ingests food to \u201cburn\u201d for fuel, the digestive and metabolic process transforms it into a kind of ash which is either acidic or alkaline. The laws of modern biochemistry further explain that it is not the organic matter of foods (whether the food itself is acidic or alkaline), but their inorganic matter (such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, phosphorous; that is, how they break down in our bodies), that determines either the acidity or alkalinity of this ashy residue.For this reason, and because all foods in nature contain both acid and alkaline-forming elements according to the\u00a0, balance is either achieved or thwarted as a direct result of the foods\u00a0we choose to eat. Too many acid-forming foods can have dire consequences for our health, with \u201cacidosis\u201d being a common diagnosis in diabetics, for example. This is because when the nutrients required to maintain this slightly alkaline\u00a0state cannot be obtained from food, the body will instead draw from its own stores, like the bones or other vital tissues \u2013 damaging its ability to repair itself and detoxify heavy metals, thereby making a person more vulnerable to fatigue and illness.

This is why it is crucial to have enough iodine in your system before the fallout even hits.You can find iodine in a number of food sources, including cod, seaweed, shrimp, eggs and tuna. Because the body cannot store it, these iodine-rich foods need to be consumed regularly in order to remain protected.

If you\u2019ve ever experienced this before then you know exactly how achy and terrible it feels upon waking. You can barely turn your neck to the side, instead you have to turn your whole upper body. The resulting limited mobility makes everything from driving and switching lanes safely to greeting people ten times more difficult, all because you unwittingly slept wrong.Another huge reason why so many of us have neck pain is our use of technology. Between the ever expanding use of cell phones and computers at work and home, we\u2019re constantly staring down at our devices and looking at screens. On average, a person spends around 2-4 hours a day crooked over looking down at their personal devices. Young adults spend much more time than that, often logging hours at a time in just one sitting.As for neck pain, the root cause of it often comes down to a shortening of the muscle. This usually happens when we\u2019re completely oblivious and unaware of the fact that we have twisted our neck in an unnatural way. The resulting strain ends up shortening the neck muscle and when this occurs it bothers the nerve, aggravating it greatly, which in turn causes us pain.

Considering the Pentagon\u2019s unusual shape, it was designed in just five days by the American architect George Bergstrom (1876\u20131955) between July 17th and July 22nd 1941. The number \u20185\u2019 features repeatedly in its design. Fuelling conspiracy theories, ground was broken for construction on September 11, 1941. However, many researchers have wondered how the controversial design was so quickly conceived. I suggest the design was based on a prehistoric monument unique to North America that, according to tradition, represented the power and dominance of the Nation. Antiquarians surveyed five unusual pentagon earthworks in Wisconsin, which incidentally was the birthplace of George Bergstrom, the Pentagon\u2019s designer. Without question, the pentagon monuments were intact and visible whilst he was growing up. Nowhere else in the world do we see this type of monumental shape, which was constructed thousands of years ago.As we shall soon see, the macabre latter-day use of the pentagon earthwork symbolically parallels the modern Pentagon\u2019s function and possible agenda. Around two hundred years ago when the pentagon monument was intact, it was recorded for prosperity by an antiquarian who traveled across America with a Native American. Thus, the information we have regarding the shape, layout and use of the monument comes from Native American tradition. We are indebted to the early archaeological records and Native narratives to understand and piece together our historical and monumental past. Pentagon earthworks One of the outstanding pentagon earthworks was located by the Kickapoo River, about 30 miles (48 kilometres) northeast of Prairie du Chien and consisted of an outer circle enclosing a pentagon, or five-angled walls, with seven earthen mounds of various dimensions, and a small inner circle.It was reported that the earthwork had been \u2018defaced by the ravages of time\u2019; however, certain areas within the monument remained \u2018perfectly intact\u2019. The outer circle was more than 1,200 feet (365.76 metres) in circumference and the earthen wall 5 feet (1.52 metres) high with a general base diameter of 12\u201316 feet (3.65\u20134.87 metres). However, the small inner circle had diminished to only 12 inches (30.48 centimetres). In contrast, the pentagon walls had retained \u2018a more perfect form\u2019.

Frequencies affect frequencies,\u00a0much like mixing ingredients with other ingredients affects the overall flavour of a meal. The way frequencies affect the physical world has been demonstrated through various experiments, such as the science of Cymatics and water memory. illustrate that when sound frequencies move through a particular medium such as water, air, or sand, they directly alter the vibration of matter.With this concept in mind, let us bring our attention to the frequency of the music we listen to.\u00a0Most music worldwide has been tuned to A=440 Hz since the International Standards Organization (ISO) promoted it in 1953. However, when looking at the vibratory nature of the universe, it\u2019s possible that this pitch is disharmonious with the natural resonance of nature and may generate negative effects on human behaviour and consciousness.", "is_fake": 1},

The old mice were given the drug and then their straggly fur began to regrow until they had coats that were luscious, while researchers also saw improvements to the kidney and liver functions of the mice. The mice were more energetic and instead of sleeping, as they had been previously, they took to running around on the wheel in their cage.The drug given to the mice wasn\u2019t a synthetic chemical; instead, it was a small peptide consisting of amino acid, which is said to be the building block of protein. Peptide drugs have previously been used in stroke therapy and researchers said that they will begin trials on human safety soon. This research has given the first real glimmer of hope for being able to destroy senescent cells in people and it is said to be a landmark advance in that field.Mice were genetically modified in Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic and the bodies killed off around 50% to 70% of the senescent cells automatically. Following treatment of six months, the mice showed they had stronger hearts, kidneys that were healthier and they also lived 20% longer. The researchers had never expected to see an improvement that was so dramatic. The study revealed that senescent cells without a shadow of a doubt contributed to ageing. If the senescent cells could be stopped then the ageing clock would also be stopped. But the biggest question for the researchers is how to make that work in a human being.", "is_fake": 1},

Drink all of the solution on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, for seven days straight. After one week you should stop for the next week, and then you can repeat it every other week thereafter. It may taste a bit too salty for your palette, but your body will thank you in the end! There are many additional benefits beyond the detox aspect of the drink. The most obvious being hydration, and when all natural sea salt is added to filtered water you\u2019re feeding your body even more nutrients and minerals. Salt water also works to stimulate digestive enzymes in your saliva and stomach that help to break up food and thus speeds up the entire process. Salt contains many healthy minerals which create an alkalizing effect that neutralizes acidity in the bloodstream. This benefits and improves bone health, especially in individuals with osteoporosis issues.Another reason to drink salt water is that unrefined salt is known to reduce both adrenaline and cortisol levels. These stress hormones are a factor in relation to insomnia and besides keeping people up at night they also make you feel jittery. By reducing their levels salt helps to calm and soothe the nervous system and that helps you get a better night\u2019s sleep. Finally, salt water contains a variety of minerals that all greatly benefit your skin. For example, iodine increases the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of the skin. Chromium does wonders to alleviate dry scalp and reduces the prevalence of skin infections. Sulfur makes skin appear more radiant and glowing by keeping it smooth and clean. And lastly, zinc regulates oil glands and helps wounds heal quickly. If you have hypertension or any preexisting medical conditions consult your doctor before beginning the cleanse.", "is_fake": 1},

B, the flagship biological research journal of the Royal Society, stated that ecologists believe that opossums are the most effective mammal at reducing the number of ticks in the wild.

The study postulated that although the white-footed mice were the chief receptacle of the Lyme bacteria, they were the natural prey of foxes who themselves are home to numerous ticks, but don\u2019t groom themselves like cats and opossums. The opossums on the other hand, whilst also home to numerous ticks, meticulously groom themselves, catching and eating over 90% of the ticks on their bodies.

Two decades ago, Russian scientists began the long project of drilling down into Lake Vostok, a mission they finally completed in February 2012. With the drilling done, the work of trying to figure out if anything is alive down there began.Scientists working with water from Lake Vostok have found genetic material that they think represents up to 3,507 different species, they report in a recent paper. The genetic material came from lake water that had frozen to the bottom of the Antarictic glacier. Comparing the genetic material against a database of species from around the world that have had their genes sequenced the scientists say that more than a thousand of these line up with known lifeforms.

The information is uploaded to a website called NextStrain.org that shows how the virus is migrating and splitting into similar but new subtypes. While researchers caution they\u2019re only seeing the tip of the iceberg, the tiny differences between the virus strains suggest shelter-in-place orders are working in some areas and that no one strain of the virus is more deadly than another. They also say it does not appear the strains will grow more lethal as they evolve.\u201cThe virus mutates so slowly that the virus strains are fundamentally very similar to each other,\u201d said Charles Chiu, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. That makes it easy to spot new lineages as they evolve, said Chiu. \u201cThe outbreaks are trackable. We have the ability to do genomic sequencing almost in real-time to see what strains or lineages are circulating,\u201d he said. So far, most cases on the U.S. West Coast are linked to a strain first identified in Washington state. It may have come from a man who had been in Wuhan, China, the virus\u2019 epicenter, and returned home on Jan. 15. It is only three mutations away from the original Wuhan strain, according to work done early in the outbreak by Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutch, a medical research center in Seattle.On the East Coast there are several strains, including the one from Washington and others that appear to have made their way from China to Europe and then to New York and beyond, Chiu said. COVID-19 hits people differently, with some feeling only slightly under the weather for a day, others flat on their backs sick for two weeks and about 15% hospitalized. Currently, an estimated 1% of those infected die. The rate varies greatly by country and experts say it is likely tied to testing rates rather than actual mortality. Chiu says it appears unlikely the differences are related to people being infected with different strains of the virus. \u201cThe current virus strains are still fundamentally very similar to each other,\u201d he said.", "is_fake": 1},

{"date": 2020, "title": "Apparently This Is The Actual Reason There Is a Huge Cotton Ball Inside Pill Bottles", "text": "To understand the meaning of cotton balls in pill bottles one must travel back in time and history to around the early 1900s. That was when the medicine company Bayer started mass producing pills and they needed a way to keep them whole and intact while in transit. In those early days pills were powdery and easily broke apart when they were jumbled around. That meant people had a greater likelihood of under or overdosing if they eyeballed the broken pills and took the wrong amount. It turned out that the simplest, safest, and most cost effective solution was to stick a cotton ball in the bottle and that is the origin of how and why cotton balls in medicines came to be.These days there is no need for the cotton balls because pills are coated and that helps prevent them from breaking apart. However, Bayer continued the practice of placing them in bottles because their consumers had grown so accustomed to them that they expected to open the cap and see the white fluff inside. When they didn\u2019t see any, people were really worried and assumed that perhaps the bottle had been tampered with. Rather than wean people off their cotton ball expectations, Bayer continued to stick them in bottles all the way up until 1999.To this day many other companies continue the practice because people still expect to see a cotton ball. According to studies, consumers equate the cotton ball with a product\u2019s freshness, but this assumption is not founded on any truth. In fact, cotton does not stand for freshness and it really is totally useless. And while many of us assume that it helps to absorb moisture and thus keeps pills for longer, it actually does the opposite and pulls moisture into the bottle. Experts say that consumers should take the cotton ball out and discard it immediately after opening. That way your medicine will truly stay dryer and fresher, and now you know why some pill bottles come with a cotton ball!", "is_fake": 1},

According to the Ummites they were able to pick up radio signals from us. Specifically,\u00a0between the 5th and 7th of February 1934 on a Norwegian ship located near the island of Terra Nova (east Canada) scientists on board were conducting telecommunication experiments attempting to send Morse code signals from their location to Bergen (Norway). \u00a0Radio communications involve the use of the ionosphere, a layer of the Earth\u00b4s atmosphere that reflects radio communications like a mirror and allows radio signals to travel large distances. That year the density of the ionosphere was at a minimum which meant that some radio signals could travel though the ionosphere in to space. Apparently, one of the Morse code radio signals escaped the Earth\u00b4s boundaries and was received by the Ummites about 14 years later. Although they did not know of the Morse code they were able to understand that the radio signal was not some random cosmic noise but that it originated from an intelligent species.In 1950 the Ummite expedition of three craft reached Earth. They landed in the lower French alps in an area known as La Javie where they set-up their first base in a remote cave. The Ummites wanted to understand us; their objective was to pass unnoticed and live among us.After 15 years of preparation and learning about our planet, in 1965, the Ummites started to contact a set of 20 carefully selected people in Spain from all walks of life\u00a0(mostly from Madrid).\u00a0They communicated\u00a0by post (typed letters), phone calls or by meeting with the contactees. During their communication they would share information about many topics. The Ummites rarely shared information to persuade contactees that they were indeed aliens. They had no interest in convincing the world that they were indeed from another planet as that would make their work on Earth more difficult They shared information about their planet and their society and about some of their old technologies that could be applicable on Earth. In a document passed on in 1967 we clearly see a description of compact disc technology which became a reality for us in the early 1980\u2019s.

The guts of these pill bugs contain a number of microbes that help the critter feed on dead, organic matter. By releasing mass quantities of pill bugs into a mature garden, one can be assured that dead plant matter is being properly broken down and returned to healthy soil. Pill bugs literally speed up the process of decomposition. They circulate the soil. This can be very useful in composting. Treats for pill bugs include fungus and monocotyledonous leaves.Pillbugs play an important role in the cycle of healthy plant life. They return organic matter to the soil so it can be digested further by fungi, protozoans and bacteria. This process produces a natural supply of nitrates, phosphates and other vital nutrients that plants need to thrive now and in future growing seasons. It is important not to introduce pill bugs into the garden too early, as they tend to munch on emerging plants. The grey soil workers often live up to three years.One very unique quality that these crustaceans possess is their ability to safely remove heavy metals from soil. For this reason, they are an important tool for cleaning up soil contaminated with pollutants like lead, cadmium and arsenic. In coal spoils and slag heaps, pill bugs come in handy. They take in heavy metals like lead and cadmium and crystallize these ions in their guts. The heavy metal toxins are then made into spherical deposits in the mid gut.

D.C. police sources said some of the items seized yesterday showed pictures of children engaged in what appeared to be \u2018cult rituals.\u2019 Officials of the U.S. Customs Service, called in to aid in the investigation, said that the material seized yesterday includes photos showing children involved in bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains. Customs officials said they were looking into whether a child pornography operation was being conducted \u2026 Their links to the D.C. area have led authorities into a far-reaching investigation that includes the Finders \u2013 a group of about 40 people that court documents allege is led by a man named\u00a0Marion Pettie\u00a0\u2013 and their various homes, including the duplex apartment building in Glover Park, the Northeast Washington warehouse and a 90 acre farm in rural Madison County, Va. \u2026 The children, identified in a court document only by the first names of Honeybee, John Franklin, Bee Bee, Max and Mary, were described as \u2018dirty unkempt, hungry, disturbed and agitated.\u2019 They had been living in the rear of the van for some time, the document said.

The entrance to the stairs are now said to be guarded, and in February 2015 it was rumored that a storm damaged the staircase so severely that it is now unusable.Maybe the shortest staircase on this list, The Forty Steps of Kandahar are no less stunning for their small number.

There are also those who make enough to live comfortably but are unable to request less hours\u2014you either work 40 hours a week, or you don\u2019t get to work at all. We submit when told what to wear, when we have to arrive and depart, when we\u2019re allowed to eat, and even when we\u2019re allowed to use the restroom. How is it we have come to allow this?The 40-hour-work week came about during the Industrial Revolution in Britain when at one point workers were putting in 10 to 16 hour days and began to protest. Working situations for Americans began to worsen as well, and by 1836, labor movement publications were also calling for a 40-hour workweek. Citizens in both situations were so overworked, an eight-hour day was easily accepted. This system is unnecessary now, if it ever was, but we still accept it due to the effects of our capitalist society.There are many contributing factors that have led to our current economic system and continued acceptance of the 40-hour workweek, three major factors being consumerism, inflation, and debt.

Okra Shows Promise In Fighting Breast Cancer and Prostate Cancer", "text": "A newly discovered lectin in common okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) was shown to kill up to 72% of human breast cancer cells (MCF7) in vitro, mostly by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis). The okra lectin was also shown to slow the growth of the breast cancer cells by 63%. Note that the lectin is found in okra seeds, and researchers in this study obtained their lectin by water extraction from okra seed meal. This anti-cancer lectin was only discovered in 2012, and interestingly, also possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive (pain relieving) properties which makes it a very interesting compound for future research. The researchers in this study noted that the lectin compound is a \u201cpotential therapeutic to combat human breast cancer.\u201d But don\u2019t scrape out the seeds and throw away the rest of the pod, because another component of okra also has demonstrated anti-cancer properties, namely the pectin.Okra pectin is found just under the skin of the pods, and scientists have discovered it contains very unique compounds (highly branched rhamnogalacturonans) which have never before been observed in other pectins. Perhaps it is the newly discovered compounds that are responsible for the effectiveness of the pectin against melanoma. In a recent study conducted by French and Dutch researchers, the pectin inhibited the proliferation of highly metastatic mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) by 75% after 48 hours of treatment and also increased the rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis) by nearly 23-fold. The researchers also discovered that the pectin triggered apoptosis by interacting with Galectin-3. This is a similar mechanism to what is observed with the well-known compound Modified Citrus Pectin, and it is very interesting that okra pectin does not have to be modified in any way to have this effect.The two studies above show clearly that two different components of okra (pectin and lectin) have potent anticancer properties, therefore as usual, we are probably better off consuming the entire edible portion of okra if we want to maximize its anti-cancer benefits. Have any actual benefits been observed in human populations? Yes. A recent cohort study carried out in the United States found that men eating a Southern dietary pattern (characterized by eating okra, grits, cornbread, beans, rice and sweet potatoes) experienced 40% less prostate cancer than those not eating such a diet. Although the result bordered on statistical significance, this was a fair-sized study which followed nearly 3,800 men for ten years. What is truly fascinating about this study is that, apart from okra, beans and sweet potatoes, the Southern eating pattern was actually not a very healthy diet, and contained high portions of red meat and bacon which are both known to increase cancer risk. Moreover, the Southern eating pattern protected men from prostate cancer much more than a vegetable and fruit rich diet did, even though it contained 24% less fruit and vegetables (29 servings weekly on the Southern diet vs. 38 servings weekly on the fruit & vegetable rich diet).", "is_fake": 1},

One of those being keeping up with the number of selfies someone admitted they had posted on social media and the other their social media selfie content being counted by someone from else. This ended up showing that women tend to post more selfies than men but what does that mean?Well, it seems measures for things like vanity, leadership, and admiration demand helped identify who were posting the most selfies in men when it came to women things were not quite the same.

When American corporations use the \u201cX\u201d in their logo, such as \u201cExxon,\u201d the historic Rockefeller firm of Standard Oil of New Jersey, there can be little doubt of this hidden meaning.\nThe importance of Nimrod in any study of the occult cannot be over-emphasized. Because of the powers given him by the clothing of Adam and Eve, Nimrod became the first man to rule the whole world. He indulged that power by launching excesses and horrors which have never been\u00a0equalled. Ever since the time of Nimrod, Babylon has been the symbol of depravity and lust. Nimrod also introduced the practice of genocide to the world. His grandfather, Ham, having consorted with other races, and brought children of mixed race into the world, was persuaded by his consort, the evil Naamah, to practice ritual murder and cannibalism. She informed Ham that by killing and eating fair-skinned people, his descendants could regain their superior qualities. Throughout the ensuing centuries, the fair-skinned descendants of Shem, Noah\u2019s oldest son, have ritually been slaughtered by the darker descendants of Ham and Nimrod, in the world\u2019s most persistent campaign of racial and religious persecution. Not only did Nimrod kill and eat the fair-skinned descendants of Shem, in his fury and hatred he often burned them alive. The type of human sacrifice involving the eating of the slaughtered human victims derived its name from the combined names of his uncle, Canaan, and the demon god Baal, the two names being combined to form the word \u201ccannibal.\u201d Nimrod was also known in ancient history by the names of Marduk, Bel, and Merodach.

While this statement seems impossible given that science is supposed to be based on evidence which produces theory, it is a delusion not to realize that much of what is strictly believed in the scientific world is only believed due to the common acceptance that is put into mainstream ideas \u2014 much like what takes place within religion. That is not to say that there aren\u2019t amazing scientists out there coming up with profound findings and adding powerful contributions to all fields, it\u2019s to bring light to the fact that in a mainstream sense one could say science is \u201cstuck\u201d or more accurately put, we have put a freeze on certain areas of science.\u201cHow can science be stuck? You are missing the point of science! Science is not a thing it\u2019s a method!\u201d While I totally agree that science is a method, what I am alluding to in this article is that many of the theories we have come to\u00a0believe\u00a0that science has produced have been scientifically proven to be incorrect yet we continue to go along with them. The reason this happens is because in many cases we are no longer using the scientific method as it is meant to be used. The stage in the method where we are supposed to go back and a re-develop a hypothesis after evidence proves the the initial theory wrong, we instead get stuck in maintaing our belief because of the money, fear, ego and pride that get in the way.I have been researching many areas of science, world events, health etc. over the past 5.5 years. I did not learn what I know in school as I left before completing any degrees. Something I whole heartedly belive is that in some ways I feel my lack of formal education has been a gift. Very often we can get stuck on the idea that what we have learned in school is absolute. It\u2019s prestigious, it can\u2019t be wrong. Heck, we paid thousands of dollars for it so it MUST be true. Yet the more I look at the people who are making scientific discoveries in the world the more I see educated people becoming livid about the fact that these new findings must not be true. It simply can\u2019t be. I have heard the statement \u201cIt\u2019s pseudo-science\u201d just about anytime a belief is challenged. A new finding requires many peer reviews for it to be taken seriously, but pre-existing mainstream beliefs require none and can be written on a cereal box yet it\u2019s still absolute fact.

ALS is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease. We are told Hawking has had ALS for over 52 years, which is a record by many decades. Jason Becker is the only person I have heard of who has lived more than 20 years with the disease, so there is about a three-decade difference between the longest survivor and the second longest survivor. That is a more than 100% difference between first and second place. It would be like Justin Gatlin running the 100 meters in 9.8 seconds, and Usain Bolt beating him with a time of 4.5 seconds. In other words, statistically it doesn\u2019t happen.The average survival time for ALS is four years. When Hawking was first diagnosed in 1963, doctors gave him two years to live. And yet here we are, 52 years later and counting. Should you believe it? Well, no. Like Becker, it appears the real Hawking did beat the odds and live for about 20 years.

In fact, the average cost for tickets sold on a Friday are 13% higher than those sold just two days later on Sunday. The main reason given for this difference is that leisure travelers book more discount trips on weekends. Also, towards the end of the work week business travelers pay for the higher fares, and many of the sales and deals that airlines run throughout the week expire by Friday.Better days on which to purchase airline tickets are Saturdays, Sundays, and Tuesdays. The study found that Tuesdays are when prices drop to the lowest cost, which on average are 3% less than Friday prices. Buying earlier, rather than last minute, always helps to keep costs low and getting alerts for sales and exclusives can pay off in the end. Ticket prices are constantly being adjusted up and down, so if you spot a good deal, grab it before it changes and goes back up.Hopefully this information will come in handy and help you snag a bargain the next time you have to book a flight.

It found, amazingly, that this acid was able to kill around 93% of these cancerous cells after 48 hours of exposure.

It apparently was an extremely effective strategy.More research needs to be done on lauric acid, with a view to developing a nature-based cancer treatment, the preliminary results from this study are certainly intriguing, particularly if similar studies are applied to other, common forms of cancer such as cancer of the breast or prostate.", "is_fake": 1},

However, contrary to what you might expect, 99% of the citric acid added to drinks and foods does not come from citrus fruits. Extracting citric acid from lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits is far too expensive for the corporations. And so we get the artificial stuff that\u00a0 you consume every time you sip your Coke. However, any concerns that the citric acid in Coke is bad for you is both erroneous and the result of an undeserved bad reputation. Basically, a study in the British Dental Journal claimed to find a strong link between carbonated beverages and tooth erosion. Consuming at least four glasses of carbonated soft drinks a day was associated with a 252% higher risk of tooth problems in 12-year-olds, and a 513% higher risk in 14-year-old children. This is almost certainly not taking other factors into account, as Coca Cola has a pH of 2.525 (Diet Coke has 3.289,) and while battery acid (an actual corrosive) has a pH very close to 1. In short, citric acid is a very weak acid, and comparing it to something truly destructive has nothing to do with reality. And now we get into more harmful territory \u2026Phosphoric acid \u2013 also known as orthophosphoric acid \u2013 is used as an acidifying agent to add tartness to cola. This, combined with the \u00a0huge amounts of high fructose corn syrup mixed in, both mask and balance the acidity of carbonated drinks. A study was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which provides reasonable evidence to support the association between consumption of cola and lower bone density. Some studies claim that phosphoric acid lowers the levels of calcium. Moreover, a team of scientists from the US National Institutes of Health has found that drinking two or more colas a day doubles the risk of kidney stones. Now, Coca-Cola contains various acids but as we discussed earlier, none are potent enough to dissolve a nail, tooth or penny in four days.If you are asking yourself how the heck mercury would have gotten into high-fructose corn syrup, here\u2019s a possible answer: mercury-grade caustic soda and hydrochloric acid are primarily used to separate corn starch from the corn kernel, and to adjust the pH level of the process. The contamination seems to occur when mercury-grade caustic soda and outdated mercury cell technology are used in the production of HFCS. The good news is that mercury-contaminated HFCS is a completely avoidable problem, since mercury-free versions of the two reagents are available.", "is_fake": 1},

{"date": 2020, "title": "Mind Control Through Neuromarketing: Where Neuroscience and Mass-Consumerism Meet", "text": "Analyzing the wasp\u2019s venom, researchers in Israel have discovered that one of the main ingredients is dopamine. It\u2019s been theorized by these researchers that this injection of dopamine inhibits rational decision-making in the roach, most notably its willingness to escape. Essentially, the roach has been robbed of free-will.Dopamine, known as the reward chemical, is most commonly released in response to something pleasurable. This can be something as simple as getting the grande cappuccino on the way home that we were looking forward to since lunch or something as complex as finally reaching the long-term goal that we set out to accomplish many years prior. Cocaine works by inhibiting the re-uptake of dopamine, thereby increasing the amount present in the synaptic cleft, leaving the user with a feeling of euphoria. Quite possibly, like the cocaine addict, the roach may understand that being a slave to the wasp is bad, but feeling euphoric, it ignores this reality. Without the use of illicit drugs, dopamine is released in response to two things: expectation of something pleasurable and the realization of obtaining something pleasurable. For example, the thought of pasta with lots of garlic, for me, triggers its release, while going to the local Italian restaurant and eating some will further trigger this. This is an extremely important point to remember, as you\u2019ll see later on. The release of this neurochemical is the sole purpose of mass-marketing.Neuromarketing is a relatively new discipline which makes use of functional MRIs (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) as well as physiological markers, such as heart rate and galvanic skin response to determine what makes consumers decide. This type of marketing has been employed by companies such as Nestle, General Motors and Coca-Cola. By using fMRI and EEGs, marketers have been able to see exactly which areas of the brain light up in response to certain advertisements. By fine-tuning these advertisements to trigger the release of feel-good neurochemicals such as dopamine, they are able to better accomplish their end-game of more sales and higher profits.

{"date": 2020, "title": "8 Reasons Why Rome Fell", "text": "The most straightforward theory for Western Rome\u2019s collapse pins the fall on a string of military losses sustained against outside forces. Rome had tangled with Germanic tribes for centuries, but by the 300s \u201cbarbarian\u201d groups like the Goths had encroached beyond the Empire\u2019s borders. The Romans weathered a Germanic uprising in the late fourth century, but in 410 the Visigoth King Alaric successfully sacked the city of Rome. The Empire spent the next several decades under constant threat before \u201cthe Eternal City\u201d was raided again in 455, this time by the Vandals. Finally, in 476, the Germanic leader Odoacer staged a revolt and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustulus. From then on, no Roman emperor would ever again rule from a post in Italy, leading many to cite 476 as the year the Western Empire suffered its deathblow.Even as Rome was under attack from outside forces, it was also crumbling from within thanks to a severe financial crisis. Constant wars and overspending had significantly lightened imperial coffers, and oppressive taxation and inflation had widened the gap between rich and poor. In the hope of avoiding the taxman, many members of the wealthy classes had even fled to the countryside and set up independent fiefdoms. At the same time, the empire was rocked by a labor deficit. Rome\u2019s economy depended on slaves to till its fields and work as craftsmen, and its military might had traditionally provided a fresh influx of conquered peoples to put to work. But when expansion ground to a halt in the second century, Rome\u2019s supply of slaves and other war treasures began to dry up. A further blow came in the fifth century, when the Vandals claimed North Africa and began disrupting the empire\u2019s trade by prowling the Mediterranean as pirates. With its economy faltering and its commercial and agricultural production in decline, the Empire began to lose its grip on Europe.The fate of Western Rome was partially sealed in the late third century, when the Emperor Diocletian divided the Empire into two halves\u2014the Western Empire seated in the city of Milan, and the Eastern Empire in Byzantium, later known as Constantinople. The division made the empire more easily governable in the short term, but over time the two halves drifted apart. East and West failed to adequately work together to combat outside threats, and the two often squabbled over resources and military aid. As the gulf widened, the largely Greek-speaking Eastern Empire grew in wealth while the Latin-speaking West descended into economic crisis. Most importantly, the strength of the Eastern Empire served to divert Barbarian invasions to the West. Emperors like Constantine ensured that the city of Constantinople was fortified and well guarded, but Italy and the city of Rome\u2014which only had symbolic value for many in the East\u2014were left vulnerable. The Western political structure would finally disintegrate in the fifth century, but the Eastern Empire endured in some form for another thousand years before being overwhelmed by the Ottoman Empire in the 1400s.", "is_fake": 1},

I\u2019ve put this together because unfortunately research shows that the impact these drugs can have on the human body goes a lot more in-depth and long-term than the short-term potential relief.Aspirin alone has been linked to numerous adverse side effects, including but not limited to: kidney failure, liver failure, ulcers, hearing loss and hemorrhagic stroke. A study conducted on the elderly in 2000 showed them to be even more at risk to being heavily affected, the study concluded that even when only taking an undersized 75mg/day dose significant changes were noted in their renal (kidney) functionality.

When food is cooked at 118 degrees or higher, its enzyme content is lost. Vitamins, minerals and protein are also abundant in raw fruits and vegetables. Drinking their juices allows you to easily assimilate these nutrients without burdening your digestive system, writes Ron Lagerquist, author of \u201cWhole Foods and Healing Recipes.\u201dEnzymes act as catalysts to chemical reactions that occur in your body. Such chemical reactions include processes that metabolize food, lessen toxin accumulation, aid in digestion, and produce cellular energy. Your body produces enzymes naturally, though your enzyme supply must be replenished. HealthMad.com notes that without a proper supply of enzymes, the body uses enzymes that are stored in your organs, thus slowing down metabolic functions.Your body can receive enzymes from fresh vegetables and fruits. However, once vegetables are cooked at 118 degrees, they loose their enzyme content. Processed or microwaved vegetables are also deficient in enzymes. As such, your body needs additional enzymes when eating cooked or processed foods. Eating raw or very lightly cooked vegetables is the best way for your body to obtain the enzymes it needs to function properly. Consequently, juicing raw vegetables enables you to consume all of the enzymes available in a fruit and likely in greater quantities than when eaten normally.", "is_fake": 1},

Although this relationship may have cooled in recent years, their traditionally close ties could result in North Korea having perhaps the strongest of allies if it wages war on the US.Despite Kim Jong-un\u2019s proclamation that he has the ability to target anywhere in the world with his countries nuclear-capable missiles, perhaps one of his biggest allies will be Russia.

Since technology and media weren\u2019t accessible to people like they are today, the industry had more control over the public and had the means to influence them anyway it wanted. This may explain why in early 1991, I was invited to attend a closed door meeting with a small group of music business insiders to discuss rap music\u2019s new direction. Little did I know that we would be asked to participate in one of the most unethical and destructive business practice I\u2019ve ever seen.The meeting was held at a private residence on the outskirts of Los Angeles. I remember about 25 to 30 people being there, most of them familiar faces. Speaking to those I knew, we joked about the theme of the meeting as many of us did not care for rap music and failed to see the purpose of being invited to a private gathering to discuss its future. Among the attendees was a small group of unfamiliar faces who stayed to themselves and made no attempt to socialize beyond their circle. Based on their behavior and formal appearances, they didn\u2019t seem to be in our industry.Our casual chatter was interrupted when we were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement preventing us from publicly discussing the information presented during the meeting. Needless to say, this intrigued and in some cases disturbed many of us. The agreement was only a page long but very clear on the matter and consequences which stated that violating the terms would result in job termination. We asked several people what this meeting was about and the reason for such secrecy but couldn\u2019t find anyone who had answers for us. A few people refused to sign and walked out.

There are two causes of lactose intolerance, and one can be blamed on your family. Primary lactose intolerance is the most common form of this deficiency and is caused by a genetic fault that runs within your genetic makeup, which is why your parents might have it too. This form normally develops at around two years old, when you\u2019ve stopped breastfeeding.

This is true, but high and low cholesterol is also genetically inherited. There are many different types of cholesterol, and researchers have told us that there are over one hundred different genes that affect our cholesterol levels and how our body manages this.

Conversely, old oceans dye when continents collide, and the oceanic crust under their pressure sinks back into the mantle. The above mentioned Tethys disappeared when Africa and India approached Eurasia, not leaving any room for the water basin before separating these continents.Obviously, even the oceans are subject to aging. Some of them are aging much faster than scientists assume. Recently, an Australian scientist Joao Duarte of Monash University and his colleagues found that the Atlantic Ocean does not have much left to live. This seems rather surprising because, according to the conventional opinion, this body of water is rather young. This is evidenced by the bottom of the subduction zones \u2013 linear stretches along which some blocks of the earth\u2019s crust dip under the others. In these areas the old crust goes into the mantle, giving place to a younger mantel. The younger mantle leaves the ground during spreading \u2013 a process of an impulsive and multiple shifts of the lithosphere of the oceanic crust and filling the freed space with magma generated in the mantle.", "is_fake": 1},

{"date": 2020, "title": "18 Reasons Why You Should NOT Vaccinate Your Children Against The Flu This Season", "text": "1. This flu is simply another flu. It is not unusually deadly. In fact, the H1N1 swine flu in circulation is less deadly than many other influenza outbreaks. The first 1000 confirmed swine flu cases in Japan and China produced zero deaths. The Centers for Disease Control alleges 36,000 Americans succumb to the flu each year, but so far, since March through August of 2009 (6 months), the swine flu has been attributed to ~500\u2014600 deaths in the US. The swine flu of 2009 has already swept through the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s flu season without alarm.\u00a0Only exaggerated reports have been issued by the World Health Organization\u00a0regarding hospitalizations required during the flu season in South American countries. Getting exposed to influenza and developing natural antibodies confers resistance for future flu outbreaks. Artificially boosting antibodies by exposure to flu viruses in vaccines is more problematic than natural exposure. Americans have been exposed to the H1N1 swine flu throughout the summer of 2009 with far fewer deaths and hospitalizations than commonly attributed to the seasonal flu.2. Health authorities tacitly admit prior flu vaccination programs were of worthless value. This is the first time both season and pandemic flu vaccines will be administered. Both seasonal flu and swine flu vaccines will require two inoculations. This is because single inoculations have failed to produce sufficient antibodies. Very young children and older frail adults, the high-risk groups in the population, may not produce sufficient antibodies in response to the flu vaccine. This is an admission that prior flu vaccines were virtually useless. The same people who brought you the ineffective vaccines in past years are bringing you this year\u2019s new vaccines. Can you trust them this time?3. In addition to failure to produce sufficient antibodies, this swine flu vaccine is brought to you by the same people who haven\u2019t been able to adequately produce a seasonal flu vaccine that matches the flu strain in circulation. In recent years flu vaccination has been totally worthless because the strains of the flu in circulation did not match the strain of the virus in the vaccines. Authorities claim the prevalent flu strain in circulation in mid-September \u201909 is the H1N1 swine flu, which appears to be milder than past seasonal influenza in circulation. If this data is correct, why receive the season flu shot this year?4. The vaccines will be produced by no less than four different manufacturers, possibly with different additives (called adjuvants) and manufacturing methods. The two flu inoculations may be derived from a multi-dose vial and in a crisis, and in short supply, it will be diluted to provide more doses and then adjuvants must be added to trigger a stronger immune response. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to boost production of antibodies but may trigger autoimmune reactions. Some adjuvants are mercury (thimerosal), aluminum and squalene. Would you permit your children to be injected with lead? Lead is very harmful to the brain. Then why would you sign a consent form for your kids to be injected with mercury, which is even more brain-toxic than lead? Injecting mercury may fry the brains of American kids.", "is_fake": 1},

Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.The calculus may be different, however, in health care settings. First and foremost, a mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection. Masking in this context is already part of routine operations for most hospitals. What is less clear is whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients.The study goes on to examine whether a mask alone is even an effective health-care measure, and discusses its capability alone devoid of other, what seem to be more important practices, like washing your hands. The point is, outside of a healthcare setting, where their usefulness is still questionable, they provide no clear protection from Covid-19, so why are they being mandated like they are? Instead of a mandate, should the citizenry simply be encouraged to wear masks, with the government explaining the science and still giving people a choice?\u00a0 Why are they saying it\u2019s to protect other people when there is no evidence that it actually does that?", "is_fake": 1},

Then, your body should, at least in theory, be trained to fight the virus if it encounters it later.
