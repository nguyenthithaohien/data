On Independence Day last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said elections would be held in J&K after the delimitation process in the Union Territory was over. Delimitation is crucial for kick-starting the political process in J&K.Delimitation is the act of redrawing boundaries of an Assembly or Lok Sabha seat to represent changes in population over time. This exercise is carried out by a Delimitation Commission, whose orders have the force of law and cannot be questioned before any court. The objective is to redraw boundaries (based on the data of the last Census) in a way so that the population of all seats, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the State. Aside from changing the limits of a constituency, the process may result in change in the number of seats in a state.Delimitation exercises in J&K in the past have been slightly different from those in the rest of the country because of the region\u2019s special status \u2014 which was scrapped by the Centre in August 2019. Until then, delimitation of Lok Sabha seats in J&K was governed by the Constitution of India, but the delimitation of the state\u2019s Assembly seats was governed by the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution and Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act, 1957.",

The conflict of interest can be in many ways \u2014 from holding shares in a company that is a litigant to having a prior or personal association with a party involved in the case.The practice stems from the cardinal principle of due process of law that nobody can be a judge in her own case. Any interest or conflict of interest would be a ground to withdraw from a case since a judge has a duty to act fair. Another instance for recusal is when an appeal is filed in the Supreme Court against a judgement of a High Court that may have been delivered by the SC judge when she was in the HC.",

Sidhu has already been vocal against the CM, accusing him of quid pro quo with the Akalis. A few MLAs and ministers also sided with the rebel camp. This prompted the AICC chief  to constitute a committee led by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.The committee, after listening to about 150 leaders including ministers, MLAs, MPs, leaders of frontal organisations and others, submitted a report to the AICC chief. It heard Amarinder also, who according to committee member JP Aggarwal explained all the points raised by the partymen. The committee has recommended that Navjot Sidhu should be given a role and the party structure should be reorganised. The AICC is yet to start any action on the report.",

Yes, and he has been for some time, according to the numbers.Djokovic leads both Roger Federer (27-23) and Rafael Nadal (30-28 after the semifinal win on Friday) in head-to-head records. He is the only player to have wins over Federer and Nadal at all four Grand Slams. He\u2019s also the only one to beat both in multiple Grand Slam finals, multiple Masters finals and in the final of the season-ending Championship.The three heavyweights have decidedly favourite kingdoms, with Djokovic holding the record of most Australian Open wins (9) and most hardcourt Majors and Masters titles overall.

To investigate, a team led by Benjamin Dekel (Sheba Medical Center, Israel) cultivated human kidney cells in lab dishes and infected them with SARS-CoV-2. They found thatPrior to infection, the cells contained high levels of interferon signalling molecules, and the infection stimulated an inflammatory response that increased these molecules. In contrast, infection of kidney cells deficient in such molecules resulted in cell death, suggesting a protective effect. The cells in these experiments were grown as a three-dimensional spheroid that imitates the healthy kidney or as a two-dimensional layer that mimics the cells of an acutely injured kidney. Cells that mimicked an acutely injured kidney were more prone to infection and additional injury but not cell death.",
