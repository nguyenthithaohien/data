Really, you can honor somebody, but this is going on day after day after day after day after day. And I don\u2019t say this out of any animus whatsoever, period. Why do some public officials get this kind of treatment \u2013 Kennedy, McCain, so forth \u2013 and others get no treatment whatsoever. You\u2019ve probably never even heard of them, probably weren\u2019t on TV as much as say McCain or Lindsey Graham and so forth.To me the heroic part of John McCain has nothing to do with his service in the Senate and everything to do with his service in the United States military, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s a hero to the American people \u2013 what he did in the United States military and what was done to him, and his bravery. And we have a gentleman \u2013 I just told you \u2013 he\u2019s still a member of the House of Representatives, by the name of Sam Johnson. Outside of Dallas, Texas, the vast majority of the American people have never heard of him. I have had him on the program in the past. And he won\u2019t get a send away like this.So, why? And again, I don\u2019t want calls on this. Is it because of his votes against Republicans, whether it was on immigration or Obamacare or tax cuts under Bush or things of that sort? I\u2019m quite serious about this. In the election of 2008, most of the same voices we\u2019re hearing today in the media and in the Democratic Party condemned McCain. Some even accused him of being racist \u2013 surprise, surprise, that\u2019s what they do \u2013 and strongly supported Obama and pushed Obama. You had nasty editorials written about McCain. They would talk about his temper. They would talk about potential\u2014they just went on and on and on. You and I, we\u2019re the ones that voted for McCain, and we lost badly. The main reason is we wanted to stop Obama. But is it because McCain didn\u2019t have fidelity to conservatism or Republicanism, or what is it? It\u2019s incredible.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the suicide rate of Americans aged 35-64 years has risen almost 29 percent from 1999 to 2010. \u00a0In Europe, the rate of employees reporting mental health issues to their employers has risen to two out of every five workers. Tremendous amounts of studies, an increase in global awareness and a shift in attitude towards treating and helping those with behavioral or mental health issues has likely brought more of these issues to light.So why are people still so hesitant to pay for psychiatric services as opposed to other forms of medical help or assistance? The reality is that your mind is just as important to treat as any other part of your body. \u00a0If you broke your leg, would you decline modern medical expertise in order to help it heal properly?
